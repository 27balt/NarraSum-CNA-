While both narratives discuss the Mueller report and its implications, they differ in their analysis of the motivations and perspectives of the Democratic leaders and the potential consequences of impeachment.\n\n**Perspective Analysis:**\n\n* **Story 1:** The Democratic leaders, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, are urging their colleagues to tone down the impeachment rhetoric, citing the need for concrete evidence of Trump's impeachable offenses. They express concerns that impeachment could be a frivolous and unjustified process, given the lack of a clear conspiracy between Trump's campaign team and Russia, and the absence of a decision on whether Trump obstructed justice. They are motivated by a desire to avoid a repeat of the 1990s Republican experience, where impeachment led to a backlash and a loss of seats in the midterm elections.\n* **Story 2:** In contrast, some Democratic presidential candidates, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Kamala Harris, are calling for impeachment proceedings, citing Trump's pattern of lying and use of his presidential power to thwart investigations. They argue that impeachment is not just about politics, but about upholding the Constitution"

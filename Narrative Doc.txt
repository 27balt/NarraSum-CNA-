story1: Manafort on his way to the FBI. They really don't make those sun visors big enough. The indictment against Paul Manafort and his former business associate Rick Gates has been unsealed and leading the list of charges is "Conspiracy Against the United States" and money laundering. "In order to hide Ukraine payments from United States authorities," the indictment reads, "from approximately 2006 through at least 2016, MANAFORT and GATES laundered the money through scores of United States and foreign corporations, partnerships, and bank accounts." Through at least 2016, "falsely and repeatedly reporting to their tax preparers and to the United States that they had no foreign bank accounts." That's just the beginning. Stay tuned!

His former business partner, Rick Gates, is also expected to surrender to authorities. Both were told to turn themselves in or face arrest. Manafort has been under FBI investigation since 2014 and has been on the radar since 2012 for shady ties to eastern European and Russian business deals. He has also been involved in foreign political races and could face charges for failing to register as a foreign agent. This is a developing story, stay tuned for updates.

story1: Last Thursday, Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) made some stunning comments to local media assessing President's Donald Trump's performance over the first seven months of his term. "The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability, nor some of the competence, that he needs to demonstrate in order for him to be successful," Corker said. He added, "[Trump] also recently has not demonstrated that he understands the character of this nation." White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has not briefed the media since Corker made his remarks. And so Thursday, she was asked to comment on the words of the Republican Senator from Tennessee -- specifically Corker's statement criticizing the President's "competence." Her response was unequivocal and fiery. "I think that's a ridiculous and outrageous claim and doesn't dignify a response from this podium," Sanders said. Well then... Good thing for Trump that he's maintaining strong relationships with other GOP Senators. Watch above, via CNN.

story2: White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders ripped Republican Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker's questioning of Trump's "stability" and "competence" on Thursday, calling Corker's claim "ridiculous and outrageous." Corker, who has been one of the more supportive voices of Trump in the Senate, raised questions about Trump's competence last week in the wake of the president's comments on the violence in Charlottesville. "He recently has not demonstrated that he understands the character of our nation -- what has made it great and what it is today. He's got to demonstrate the characteristics of a president who understands that. Without those things happening, our nation is going to go through great peril," Corker said of Trump. "The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability, nor some of the competence, that he needs to demonstrate in order for him to be successful -- and our nation and our world needs for him to be successful, whether you are Republican or Democrat," Corker added. Asked about Corker's claim at the White House press briefing, Sanders kept her answer brief. "I think that's a ridiculous and outrageous claim and doesn't dignify a response from this podium," Sanders said.

story1: HANNITY at 9:15pm: "How many times has The New York times & others gotten it wrong?" HANNITY at 9:55pm: "Yeah maybe Donald Trump wanted to fire the special counsel for conflict. Does he not have the right to raise those questions? You know, we'll deal with this tomorrow night." pic.twitter.com/CKvYqsNwR1 Sean Hannity on Thursday night was forced to backtrack on his own show as Fox News confirmed a New York Times report he had just attacked. Earlier in his show, Hannity blasted a report that said President Donald Trump had tried to fire special counsel Robert Mueller last year and accused the Times of "trying to distract you." "Our sources, and I've checked in with many of them, they're not confirming that tonight," he said. "And how many times has the New York Times and others gotten it wrong?" By the end of the show, he was forced to admit that Fox News had confirmed the Times report. His response? First he said the president has the right to "raise those questions" about conflicts of interest without actually addressing Trump's reported attempt to fire Mueller, promising to deal with it tomorrow. Then, the man who had earlier in the show accused the Times of distraction quickly switched to footage of a police chase and car crash.
story2: Fox News host Sean Hannity said on his program Thursday evening that the New York Times is trying to "distract" with its report that President Trump ordered special counsel Robert Mueller to be fired in June 2017. "Tonight they're trying to change the story," Hannity said while pointing to the Trump administration voluntarily handing over thousands of documents to the special counsel. "At this hour the New York Times is trying to distract you," Hannity added during his opening monologue. "They have a story trump wanted Mueller fired last June and our sources -- and I've checked with many of them, they're not confirming that tonight." Earlier in the evening the New York Times reported that Trump ordered Mueller to be fired last June but backed off after White House counsel Donald McGahn threatened to quit. Since the Times released the report, Fox News has independently confirmed the story as well as the Washington Post. Hannity has condemned Mueller as special counsel in the past and called for him to resign.

And if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS, which is a major fight -- and Islamic terrorism all over the world -- that's a good thing. O'Reilly: But he's a killer though. Putin's a killer. Trump: There are a lot of killers. We've got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our country's so innocent?
story2: President Donald Trump said he had respect for Russian President Vladimir Putin and asked whether the United States is innocent in an interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly set to air ahead of the Super Bowl on Sunday. "I respect a lot of people, that doesn't mean I'm going to get along with him," Trump told O'Reilly. "He's a leader of his country, and I say it's better to get along with Russia than not and if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS which is a major fight and Islamic terrorism all over the world and major fight, that's a good thing. Will I get along with him? I have no idea." When O'Reilly fired back, calling Putin a killer, Trump responded, "There are a lot of killers. You think our country is so innocent?" Trump has said he would be willing to work with Putin even after the Obama administration sanctioned Russia for its cyberattacks and intervention during the 2016 presidential campaign. The interview will air on Fox broadcast stations at 4 p.m. Eastern ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl, with more segments airing on Fox News Channel's "O'Reilly Factor" on Monday and Tuesday. Trump in the interview also touched on voter fraud and how it is "a really bad situation." But O'Reilly questioned the president on the veracity of his claim that 3 million illegal immigrants voted in the election, noting that he needed data to back it up. "Let me just tell you -- when you see illegals, people that are not citizens and they are on registration rolls ... look, Bill, we can be babies, but you take a look at the registration, you have illegals, you have dead people, you have this, it's really a bad situation. It's really bad."

story1: WASHINGTON -- Special counsel Robert Mueller's team has issued a subpoena to the Trump campaign asking multiple campaign officials to produce Russia-related documents, according to a source with first-hand knowledge of the matter. The subpoena was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which also said that the subpoena does not compel testimony by any of the officials. The source said the campaign has already turned over some 20,000 documents voluntarily, so it's not clear why the subpoena was issued. A subpoena ratchets up the stakes for noncompliance. Play Facebook Twitter Embed Mueller issues grand jury subpoenas for Trump campaign documents 3:28 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog The Journal reported that the Trump campaign had been caught by surprise by the subpoena. Mueller, a former FBI director, and his investigators are probing any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election. Congressional committees that are also investigating possible collusion had asked the the campaign to turn over Russia-related material dating back to the beginning of Trump's campaign in summer 2015. On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee said that Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, had failed to turn over all the documents it had requested.
story2: According to the Wall Street Journal, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian collusion and election tampering included issuing subpoenas for over a dozen Trump campaign officials. According to the report, the subpoenas were issued in mid-October and the campaign officials have been providing documents to the investigation having to do with the Russian government. A lawyer for the president said there was "total cooperation" with the investigation. What do we know so far about Mueller's investigation? Leaks from Mueller's investigation have indicated that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort was being targeted in the probe - he has since been charged with conspiracy against the United States and money laundering. Former campaign official George Papadopoulos was also reported to have pleaded guilty to lying to federal officials about his interactions with the Russians. Mueller appeared to be at the center of the controversy over President Trump's anger at Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigations. Trump blames Sessions for the creation of the special counsel, though even his allies have pointed out that it was Trump's own actions that precipitated the naming of Mueller.

story1: President Trump’s eldest son said Sunday that there was more to his meeting with a Russian lawyer last year than previously acknowledged, prompting fresh speculation about Trump campaign intrigue with the Kremlin. In a startling switch, however, Donald Trump Jr. said the lawyer claimed Russia was working to help Hillary Clinton’s campaign.  When the New York Times first reported the meeting Saturday, the younger Mr. Trump issued a statement saying the meeting was focused mainly on a discontinued program for U.S. adoptions of Russian children.  He issued a new statement Sunday, acknowledging the meeting was set up by an acquaintance he knew from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow who said the lawyer might have information helpful to the Trump campaign.  The meeting in June 2016 with a lawyer with Kremlin ties, who was later identified as Natalia Veselnitskaya, was also attended by Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and top advisor Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul J. Manafort.  The younger Mr. Trump said that during the meeting Ms. Vesenlantskaya claimed to have information that “individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee” and supporting Clinton.  “No details or supporting information was provided or even offered,” the younger Mr. Trump said in a statement. “It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.”  He said no details or supporting information was ever offered, and that his father was unaware of the meeting.  Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Trump’s legal team, said the president was “not aware of and did not attend the meeting.”  The younger Mr. Trump had not disclosed the meeting prior to the news report.  Mr. Kushner, who works as a top adviser to the president, later reported the meeting on White House disclosure forms.  The president’s opponents in the U.S. seized on the story as fresh evidence of possible collusion. The FBI has uncovered no evidence of collusion after a yearlong investigation, but they continue, including a Justice Department special counsel probe that began in May.  • This article is based in part on wire service reports.

story2: President Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., was promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton before agreeing to meet with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign, according to three advisers to the White House briefed on the meeting and two others with knowledge of it.  The meeting was also attended by the president’s campaign chairman at the time, Paul J. Manafort, as well as by the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Mr. Manafort and Mr. Kushner recently disclosed the meeting, though not its content, in confidential government documents described to The New York Times.  The Times reported the existence of the meeting on Saturday. But in subsequent interviews, the advisers and others revealed the motivation behind it.  The meeting — at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016, two weeks after Donald J. Trump clinched the Republican nomination — points to the central question in federal investigations of the Kremlin’s meddling in the presidential election: whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians. The accounts of the meeting represent the first public indication that at least some in the campaign were willing to accept Russian help.

story1: "A new 2015 IRS filing calls into question just how charitable the Donald J. Trump Foundation really is.  Continue Reading Below  The forms, posted late Monday on nonprofit tracking site GuideStar and first discovered by the Washington Post, reveal the foundation has admitted to violating the legal ban on “self-dealing,” meaning the charity’s funds were improperly used by an insider, their friends or family members.  Representatives for the foundation checked “yes” on the section of the form asking whether assets had been transferred “to a disqualified person” in 2015 and in previous years. In the case of the Trump Foundation, a disqualified person could include Trump himself, people close to him or even his businesses.  A spokeswoman from law firm Morgan, Lewis and Bockus, which uploaded the documents, declined to comment. The Trump campaign and the Trump Organization did not return calls for comment at the time of publication.  While it is unclear whether the same 990 forms were actually sent to the IRS, a spokeswoman from GuideStar told FOXBusiness.com the following:  “We can confirm that someone with the email address matching Morgan Lewis’ domain uploaded the 990. It is important to note that since this is a self-uploaded document it may not be the exact/final version they sent to the IRS (if it was already sent).”  Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT  The penalties for such violations range from an excise tax to forcing the repayment of money unlawfully obtained from the foundation, according to the Post.  The Washington Post has been following other suspicious practices at the Donald J. Trump Foundation in recent years, including the use of the charity’s money to settle legal disputes for Trump’s businesses and also to purchase multiple items at charity auctions on behalf Trump and his wife, Melania. As a result of these allegations, the New York Attorney General’s office has opened an ongoing investigation into the nonprofit.  These specific forms do not offer any color as to the exact nature of the violation the foundation is reporting, and whether it is related to any of the aforementioned incidents.  Also noteworthy from the filing was the foundation’s contribution to Project Veritas, the activist organization responsible for the release of undercover footage of alleged attempts at voter fraud by the Democratic Party this fall.  The foundation has paid penalties in the past, including a $2,500 fine for illegally gifting $25,000 to Pam Biondi’s campaign for Florida AG in 2013. At the time, Biondi was allegedly deciding whether to investigate fraud allegations against Trump University, which she ultimately declined to follow through on.  At the end of 2015, the Trump Foundation had $1.1 million; throughout the year the foundation took in $781,000 while giving away $896,000. The charity received $566,370 from the Trump Corporation in 2015, the first time an organization fully owned by the businessman has donated to the foundation since 2008."
story2: "Painter Michael Israel, left, poses with Donald and Melania Trump in 2007 at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club. Trump spent $20,000 that belonged to the Donald J. Trump Foundation to buy a six-foot-tall portrait of himself painted by Israel. (Michael Israel)  President-elect Donald Trump’s charitable foundation has admitted to the Internal Revenue Service that it violated a legal prohibition against “self-dealing,” which bars nonprofit leaders from using their charity’s money to help themselves, their businesses or their families.  The admission was contained in the Donald J. Trump Foundation’s IRS tax filings for 2015, which were recently posted online at the nonprofit-tracking site GuideStar. A GuideStar spokesman said the forms were uploaded by the Trump Foundation’s law firm, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius.  The Washington Post could not immediately confirm if the same forms had actually been sent to the IRS.  In one section of the form, the IRS asked whether the Trump Foundation had transferred “income or assets to a disqualified person.” A disqualified person, in this context, might be Trump — the foundation’s president — or a member of his family or a Trump-owned business.  The foundation checked yes.    For 2015, the Trump Foundation checked “yes” when asked whether it had transferred “income or assets to a disqualified person” — which in this context might be Trump, a member of his family or a Trump-owned business — and checked “yes” again when asked if it had engaged in any acts of self-dealing in prior years. For 2014, The foundation answered “no” to these questions.  Another line on the form asked whether the Trump Foundation had engaged in any acts of self-dealing in prior years. The Trump Foundation checked yes again.  Such violations can carry penalties including excise taxes, and the charity leaders can be required to repay money that the charity spent on their behalf.  During the presidential campaign, The Post reported on several instances in which Trump appeared to use the Trump Foundation’s money to buy items for himself or to help one of his for-profit businesses.  But the new Trump Foundation tax filings provided little detail, so it was unclear if these admissions were connected to the instances reported in The Post.  [Trump boasts about his philanthropy. But his giving falls short of his words.]  The Trump Foundation tax forms did not, for instance, describe any specific acts of self-dealing. They also did not say whether Trump had paid any penalties already. That kind of detail would be submitted on a separate IRS form, which was not included in the information posted online by GuideStar.  Trump’s team did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.  Washington Post reporter David A. Fahrenthold has been searching for evidence of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s charitable giving for months. (Peter Stevenson,Julio Negron/The Washington Post)  The New York attorney general’s office is investigating Trump’s charity, following up on reports in The Post that described apparent instances of self-dealing going back to 2007. A spokesman for Attorney General Eric Schneiderman declined to comment, other than to say “our investigation is ongoing.”  The IRS also did not immediately respond. That agency has not said if it is investigating the president-elect’s charity.  The Trump Foundation has existed since 1987. This appeared to be the first time that it had admitted committing such a violation.  Philip Hackney, who formerly worked in the IRS chief counsel’s office and now teaches at Louisiana State University, said he wanted to know why the Trump Foundation was now admitting to self-dealing in prior years — when, in all prior years, it had told the IRS it had done nothing of the kind.  “What transactions led to the self-dealing that they’re admitting to? Why weren’t they able to recognize them in prior years,” Hackney said. He said that, since the prior years’ returns were signed by Trump, that opened the president-elect to questions about what he had missed and how.  Trump Foundation 2015 tax filing  During the presidential campaign, The Post revealed several instances — worth about $300,000 — where Trump seemed to have used the Trump Foundation to help himself. From 2009 until this year, the charity was funded exclusively with other people’s money, an arrangement that experts say is almost unheard of for a family foundation.  In two cases, The Post reported, the Trump Foundation appeared to pay legal settlements to end lawsuits that involved his for-profit businesses.  In one case, Trump settled a dispute with the town of Palm Beach, Fla., over a large flagpole he erected at his Mar-a-Lago Club. The town agreed to waive $120,000 in unpaid fines if Trump’s club donated $100,000 to Fisher House, a charity helping wounded veterans and military personnel. The Trump Foundation paid that donation instead — effectively saving his business $100,000.  In another, Trump’s golf course in New York’s Westchester County was sued by a man who had won a $1 million hole-in-one prize during a tournament at the course. The man was later denied the money because Trump’s course had allegedly made the hole too short for the prize to be valid.  The lawsuit was settled, and details on that final settlement have not been made public. But on the day that the parties told the court that their lawsuit had been settled, the Trump Foundation donated $158,000 to the unhappy golfer’s charity. Trump’s golf course donated nothing.  In three other cases, Trump’s foundation paid for items that Trump or his wife purchased at charity auctions. In 2012, Trump bid $12,000 for a football helmet signed by then-Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow. In another case from 2007, Trump’s wife, Melania, bid $20,000 on a six-foot-tall portrait of Trump painted by “speed painter” Michael Israel during a gala at Mar-a-Lago. And in 2014, Trump bid $10,000 to buy a four-foot painting of himself by artist Havi Schanz at another charity gala.  [How a Univision anchor found the missing $10,000 portrait that Trump bought with his charity’s money]  In all three cases, the Trump Foundation paid the bill. Tax experts said that, by law, the items had to be put to charitable use. Trump’s representatives have not said what became of the helmet or the $20,000 portrait.  The $10,000 portrait was, however, located by Post readers, following coverage of the Trump Foundation. It was hanging on the wall of the sports bar at Trump’s Doral golf resort, outside Miami.  In September, a Trump campaign spokesman rejected the idea that Trump had done anything wrong, by using his charity’s money to buy art for his bar. Instead, spokesman Boris Epshteyn said, the sports bar was doing the charity a favor by “storing” its art free of charge.  Tax experts said that this argument was unlikely to hold water.  “It’s hard to make an IRS auditor laugh,” Brett Kappel, a lawyer who advises nonprofit groups at the Akerman firm, told The Post then. “But this would do it.”  In the new 2015 tax filing, the Trump Foundation acknowledged for the first time that it owned these items. But it listed market values far below what the foundation had paid: The helmet was valued at $475, the portrait purchased for $20,000 was valued at $700, and the portrait purchased for $10,000 was valued at $500.  The tax filing did not give any details about where these items are or what charitable use Trump has in mind for them.  The Trump Foundation’s tax filing also shows that — for the first time in six years — the foundation received a donation from an entity controlled by Trump himself.  It lists a donation of $566,370 from the Trump Corporation, an entity 100 percent owned by Trump himself. It also lists a $50,000 gift from Trump Productions, a Trump-owned business that produced “The Apprentice.”  Previously, the last donation to the foundation from Trump or one of his businesses had come in 2008. Trump’s spokesmen did not respond to a question about the reason for these new gifts.  In addition, the Trump Foundation reported a $150,000 gift from the foundation of Viktor Pinchuk, a powerful Ukrainian steel magnate. That was the first such gift from him.  Pinchuk, who supports closer ties between Ukraine and Western nations, had also pledged large donations to the foundation of Trump’s presidential opponent, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Those donations, pledged to the Clinton Foundation while Clinton was secretary of state, raised questions about whether she had conflicts of interest when she met with her family foundation’s donors.  A spokesman for Pinchuk’s foundation said that the gift was made as part of an agreement for Trump to speak — via video link — to a conference Pinchuk organized in September 2015. The conference, called the Yalta European Strategy annual meeting, was held in Kiev. At the time of his 20-minute speech, titled “How New Ukraine’s Fate Affects Europe and the World,” Trump was already a presidential candidate.  Trump’s spokesmen did not respond to a question about Pinchuk’s gift.  [How Donald Trump retooled his charity to spend other people’s money]  Marc S. Owens, the former head of the IRS nonprofit division, noted that this was a rare contribution to the Trump Foundation from overseas. The only other foreign gifts were small ones from New Zealand and Canada in 2006 and 2008. And it was certainly the first from a foreigner who could seek to influence the foreign policy agenda of a President Trump.  “The contribution points out a potential way for foreign donors to align themselves with [Trump],” Owens said.  So far, Trump has said nothing about how he will run his foundation when he takes office — or what he will do to avoid potential conflicts of interest involving Trump Foundation donors.  In contrast, when she was preparing to take office as secretary of state in 2009, Clinton was closely questioned about the operations of the global charity founded by her husband. As a result, the president of the Clinton Foundation signed a memorandum of understanding with the Obama administration that placed certain restrictions on its activities, notably limiting some donations from foreign governments.  The agreement was criticized by Republicans during the campaign for loopholes, and the Clinton Foundation has also acknowledged at least one failure to fully uphold its terms. But the document showed an understanding that some additional transparency and regulations were needed while Clinton held public office.  “I will certainly do everything in my power to make sure that the good work of the foundation continues without there being any untoward effects on me and my service and be very conscious of any questions that are raised,” Clinton said during her 2009 confirmation hearing. “But I think that the way that this has been hammered out is as close as we can get to doing something that is so unprecedented that there is no formula for it, and we’ve tried to do the very best we could.”  The Post was first alerted to the 2015 tax filing by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal watchdog group. In a written statement, CREW spokesman Jordan Libowitz said many questions remained to be answered.  “Why were the Trumps unable to provide locations of the Foundation’s assets like paintings and football helmets . . . when they clearly remain in the possession of the Foundation? What assets do [they] admit to transferring to a ‘disqualified person?’ ” Libowitz wrote. “It’s pretty clear at this point that the IRS needs to investigate.”  In all, the 2015 tax filing shows that the Trump Foundation took in $781,000 and gave away $896,000 in grants during 2015. That left it with $1.1 million at year’s end, slightly down from the year before.  An early look at its outgoing grants showed a familiar pattern: Trump gave to a smattering of New York and Florida charities, plus a few connected to friends and business partners. Also, as he entered the presidential race, he gave to several nonprofit organizations connected with conservative causes.  One of them was Project Veritas, the group run by conservative provocateur James O’Keefe, which has used hidden-camera stings to target liberal groups. Stephen Gordon, of Project Veritas, said that its point of contact had been Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s one-time campaign manager.  He said they had a brief meeting with Trump in 2015 at Trump Tower. Trump gave $10,000 from his foundation to the group, which is an IRS-certified nonprofit organization.  “We showed him a couple of videos. He thought that was really cool. And we walked out with a check. It was a typical donor meeting,” Gordon recalled.  Rosalind S. Helderman contributed to this report."

story1: "HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced Wednesday the government will formally withdraw an extradition bill that sparked months of demonstrations, bowing to one of the protesters’ demands in the hope of ending the increasingly violent unrest.  But lawmakers warned that the bill’s withdrawal was not enough to end the turmoil, which has increasingly focused on alleged police brutality against protesters and democratic reforms.  The bill would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to mainland China for trials. It has prompted massive protests since June that disrupted transport links and caused the airport to shut down earlier this month.  Lam said the government would not accept other demands including an independent inquiry into alleged police misconduct and the unconditional release of those detained. Instead, she named two new members to a police watchdog agency investigating the matter.  “The government will formally withdraw the bill in order to fully allay public concerns,” she said in a recorded television message.  She said the persistent violence is damaging the rule of law and that moves to vandalize the national flag and emblem were a direct challenge to the “one country, two systems” policy and had put Hong Kong in a “highly vulnerable and dangerous situation.”  “Our foremost priority now is to end violence, to safeguard the rule of law and to restore order and safety in society,” she added, vowing to “strictly enforce the law against all violent and illegal acts.”  Lam said it was clear that public frustration has gone far beyond the bill and that her government will seek a dialogue with aggrieved groups to “address the discontent in society and to look for solutions.”  She said she will also invite community leaders, professionals and academics to examine deep-seated problems in the society and advise the government on solutions.  “Let’s replace conflicts with conversations, and let’s look for solutions,” she said.  Lam made the announcement after meeting with pro-government lawmakers and members of the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.  Lawmaker Michael Tien, who was at the meeting, said the move would not change public sentiment if it isn’t accompanied by other concessions.  “It is too little, too late. The focus now has completely shifted. Most people do not remember what the bill is about but are more concerned about the escalating violence and alleged police heavy-handedness against protesters,” he said.  He said Lam rejected his call during the meeting for an independent inquiry which would have the power to summon witnesses, on the ground that it would overlap with the police watchdog probe.  Pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo said the protesters are adamant that all their demands, including calls for direct elections, are fulfilled. She mocked Lam’s bid to seek dialogue to address public grievances.  “She has been fast asleep these three months, this is just absurd,” Mo said. “The scars and wounds are still bleeding, and she thinks she can just use some garden hose to put out the hill fire. That is not acceptable.”  Pro-establishment lawmaker Starry Lee, however, urged protesters to accept the government’s olive branch so the city can move forward.  The Hong Kong stock market soared 4%, boosted by reports of the bill’s withdrawal.  Lam has come under withering criticism for pushing the extradition bill, which many in Hong Kong see as an example of the city’s eroding autonomy since the former British colony returned to Chinese control in 1997.  She was elected as Hong Kong’s chief executive by a pro-Beijing committee of Hong Kong elites, and the mainland government has spoken in support of her government and the city’s police force throughout the protests.  Clashes between police and protesters have become increasingly violent, with demonstrators throwing gasoline bombs and rods at officers in protests last weekend. Authorities in turn have employed water cannons, tear gas, rubber bullets and batons. More than 1,100 people have been detained.  The mostly young protesters say that a degree of violence is necessary to get the government’s attention after peaceful rallies were futile. In Beijing, the mainland office responsible for Hong Kong has warned that China will “not sit idly by” if the situation worsens.  The prolonged protests have hurt Hong Kong’s economy amid a slowdown in the Chinese economy and its trade war with the United States.  Hong Kong and foreign companies have also been under intense pressure to support China’s ruling Communist Party against the protesters.  The chairman of Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways resigned Wednesday, becoming the second top figure to leave the airline since the protests erupted.  Cathay said John Slosar was retiring from the airline, one of Hong Kong’s most prominent businesses. It comes less than one month after Cathay’s CEO, Rupert Hogg, resigned following pressure by Beijing over participation by some of the carrier’s employees in protests.  ___  Associated Press writers Joe McDonald in Beijing and Eileen Ng in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, contributed to this report.

(CNN) —  Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam has finally fully withdrawn a controversial bill that allowed extradition to mainland China and sparked three months of dramatic protests in the financial hub.  The decision to cave in to one of protesters’ five core demands marked a dramatic U-turn for Lam, who for months has refused to withdraw the bill.  “We must find ways to address the discontent in society and look for solutions,” Lam said in a a video statement Wednesday evening. “After more than two months of social unrest, it is obvious to many that this discontentment extends far beyond the bill.”  But Lam refused to give ground on protesters’ four other demands, including greater democracy for the city and an independent commission into police conduct, saying all investigations would be carried out by the existing Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC).  Carrie Lam's four actions 1. Hong Kong government officially withdraws extradition bill  2. Two new members appointed to Independent Police Conduct Commission  3. More direct communication with the community  4. Calls for community leaders to "independently examine" problems in society  Instead, she announced the addition of a former education bureau chief and former judge to the IPCC. Lam said the government’s priority now was to restore law and order to Hong Kong. “Let’s replace conflicts with conversations and let’s look for solutions,” she said.  Lam suspended the extradition bill in June after more than 1 million people marched against it, with protesters surrounding the city’s legislature on the day of its planned second reading.  That suspension did not satisfy protesters, who demanded the bill’s complete withdrawal – making it harder for the government to rush the law through at a later date. A withdrawn bill would need to go back to the beginning of the legislative process, whereas a suspended one could resume where it left off.  In recent weeks, protesters’ tactics have become increasingly violent as young people felt the government was refusing to consider their demands.  Pro-Beijing lawmaker Michael Tien said that Lam’s withdrawal may not stem their anger. “I believe the withdrawal of the bill … may be too late because this movement has become more than the bill,” he said.  Hong Kong protesters' 5 demands Fully withdraw the extradition bill  Set up an independent inquiry to probe police brutality  Withdraw the characterization of protests as "riots"  Release those arrested at protests  Implement universal suffrage in Hong Kong  Activist Joshua Wong, who was last week arrested in a police sweep of activists and opposition politicians, wrote on Twitter: “Carrie Lam’s repeated failure in understanding the situation has made this announcement completely out of touch - She needs to address to ALL Five Demands: STOP PROSECUTION, STOP CALLING US RIOTERS, INDEPENDENT INQUIRY OF POLICE and FREE ELECTION!”  Initial response to Carrie Lam:    1. Too little and too late now — Carrie Lam's response comes after 7 lives sacrificed, more than 1,200 protestors arrested, in which many are mistreated in police station. — Joshua Wong 黃之鋒 😷 (@joshuawongcf) September 4, 2019  Earlier this week, Lam denied that she had offered to resign over her handling of the crisis after a recording published Monday night of her at a meeting with business leaders was leaked to Reuters. On the tape, she can be heard saying she would have quit “if I have a choice.”  Lam not resigning  Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Lam said she had not “contemplated to discuss a resignation” with her mainland superiors.  In the recording, Lam can be heard saying the bill was “not something instructed, coerced by the central government.”  “If I have a choice, the first thing is to quit, having made a deep apology,” she said. “We were not sensitive enough to feel and grasp (the) huge degree of fear and anxiety amongst people of Hong Kong vis-à-vis the mainland of China.”  “For a chief executive to have caused this huge havoc to Hong Kong is unforgivable,” Lam added.  That may remain the view for many Hong Kongers even after the formal withdrawal of the bill. Many will be asking why it took three months of unprecedented unrest, violence and damage to the city’s economy for the government to upgrade the bill from “suspended” to “withdrawn,” despite repeatedly insisting that it had no future and would not be reintroduced.  Lam may be hoping that the move will put a lid on the protests ahead of October 1, when China will celebrate National Day and mark 70 years of the People’s Republic.  But whether this will be the case remains highly uncertain.  “The nature of the protest movement has transformed over the last 13 weeks,” said Adam Ni, a China researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney.  “She will have to take further steps, such as setting up an independent inquiry into police conduct. If she does not take further steps, then we can expect the protests to continue.”"

story1: "Top Congressional Republicans condemned Tuesday the decision by President Barack Obama to commute former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning’s 35-year prison sentence for leaking classified documents.  House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., blasted the decision, calling it “outrageous.”  “Chelsea Manning’s treachery put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation’s most sensitive secrets. President Obama now leaves in place a dangerous precedent that those who compromise our national security won’t be held accountable for their crimes,” Ryan said in a statement.  Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the decision was a “grave mistake.”  "It is a sad, yet perhaps fitting commentary on President Obama’s failed national security policies that he would commute the sentence of an individual that endangered the lives of American troops, diplomats, and intelligence sources by leaking hundreds of thousands of sensitive government documents to Wikileaks, a virulently anti-American organization that was a tool of Russia’s recent interference in our elections."  Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla, went on further to echo the statements of Ryan and McCain.  “It is shameful that President Obama is siding with lawbreakers and the ACLU against the men and women who work every day to defend our nation and safeguard U.S. government secrets.”  OBAMA COMMUTES CHELSEA MANNING’S SENTENCE FOR LEAKING ARMY DOCUMENTS  Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, told Fox News that while pardons are a Constitutional tool in the president's repertoire, Obama is "undermining our ability on criminal justice reform by granting clemency at an alarming rate."  According to ABC News, Defense Secretary Ash Carter was one of the U.S. officials who were also opposed to the White House’s decision to commute Manning’s sentence.  Manning is more than six years into a 35-year sentence at the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas for leaking classified government and military documents to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. Her sentence is now set to expire May 17.  Manning was known as Bradley Manning at the time of her 2010 arrest, but revealed after being convicted of espionage that she identifies as a woman.  Manning accepted responsibility for leaking the material to WikiLeaks to raise public awareness about the effects of war on civilians, and has said she was confronting gender dysphoria at the time of the leaks while deployed in Iraq.  She attempted suicide twice last year, according to her lawyers, citing her treatment at Leavenworth.  Chase Strangio, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Manning, said the president's action "quite literally save Chelsea's life."  WILL WIKILEAKS’ JULIAN ASSANGE MAKE GOOD ON HIS OFFER TO TURN HIMSELF IN AFTER MANNING CLEMENCY?  In a conference call with White House reporters, an official said the decision to grant a commutation to Manning was not influence anyway by Julian Assange or WikiLeaks. A separate White House official said that more commutations should be expected before Obama leaves office.  The U.S. Army declined to comment on the announcement when asked by The Associated Press.  WikiLeaks said earlier this week that Assange would accept extradition to the U.S. if Obama granted clemency to Manning.  Commutations reduce sentences being served but don't erase convictions. Pardons generally restore civil rights, such as voting, often after a sentence has been served.  Most of the other people receiving commutations were serving sentences for nonviolent drug offenses.  Fox News’ Chad Pergram and the Associated Press contributed to this report."
story2: "A day before leaving office, President Barack Obama broke one of his own records. By using the president’s pardon powers and shortening the prison sentences of 330 prison inmates convicted of drug crimes, he made Thursday the biggest use of clemency by a president in a single day in US history — breaking a record he himself set earlier in the week.  It’s the culmination of a year-long effort to use the president’s clemency power to get hundreds of people — most of them nonviolent drug offenders — out of prison sooner. And it tops off another presidential record: With 1,927 people granted some form of clemency, Obama has used his clemency powers more than any president since Harry Truman (excluding Gerald Ford’s clemency for thousands of Vietnam War draft dodgers).  Depending on how you look at it, Obama’s effort in the twilight of his presidency is either a historic act of criminal justice reform — or too little too late. Obama’s rejected thousands of petitions for reduced sentences, and there are still thousands more waiting for review — and the Trump administration, under Attorney General–nominee Jeff Sessions, is extremely unlikely to give them a second look.  The Thursday actions are the last batch of clemency approvals that Obama will grant. But while it’s now clear that Obama’s done something very significant indeed, it’s also near-certain that it will, in some ways, fall short.  Obama’s last-minute clemency push  The president’s power of clemency — which includes both officially absolving people with criminal convictions of their crimes (pardons) and reducing sentences of people currently incarcerated (commutations) — is established in the Constitution, and it’s very broad. So even though pardons and commutations are given to individual people, it’s arguably the most direct tool the president has to reduce mass incarceration if he so chooses.  In the last year of his presidency, Obama has stepped up to the plate. He’s used the pardon power to reduce more sentences than any other president — thanks almost entirely to his administration’s actions over the past year.  Obama’s been a critic of mass incarceration, or at least of disproportionate sentences for drug crimes (which are the most common type of crime among federal prisoners), since he came into office. But for the first several years of his presidency, he was historically stingy in using the pardon power to help prisoners he claimed were serving unfair sentences.  The change from then to now is a story of how easy it is for a single federal official to slow down a process — and how hard it is for a single official to speed it up.  For the first term of his presidency, the head of the Office of the Pardon Attorney was a “tough-on-crime” holdover from the George W. Bush administration. The chief pardon attorney was so resistant to pardoning federal prisoners that in at least one case he withheld relevant evidence that would have made a pardon applicant look better when presenting the application to Obama for review.  In early 2014, the Obama administration decided it would do a 180 on the pardon office — and try to use it as a way to affirmatively get people out of prison. It replaced the pardon attorney with a prisoners rights advocate, and encouraged thousands of federal prisoners who’d been sentenced under now-obsolete laws or policies to apply to get their sentences reduced to current levels.  The applications came in. The approvals did not. It turned out that using the pardon power to grant big batches of commutations wasn’t just a matter of who was at the head of the pardon office, but how willing Department of Justice leadership and the White House were to take risks. (When politicians are afraid that just one person they release can go on to commit another crime, it makes it hard to release anyone at all.)  In early 2016, the pardon attorney Obama had hired to oversee the commutation push quit — with a letter making it clear that she didn’t feel the administration was keeping its promises on clemency. Days after her resignation, the commutations picked up. And they’ve barely stopped since.  Thousands of prisoners are still waiting — and President Trump is unlikely to help  Obama didn’t approve all the petitions he got. As of late December, nearly 14,000 applications for commutations (many of them submitted per the White House’s 2014 request) were still pending, along with more than 2,000 applications for full pardons. And the administration had already formally denied more than 16,000 petitions.  Obama could have approved every one of those applications, and it would still be a drop in the mass incarceration bucket — since his actions focused mostly on drug offenders. While about half of federal prisoners are incarcerated for drug crimes, prison sentences for drugs aren’t the biggest cause of mass incarceration in the US as a whole: Only about 16 percent of state prisoners, who make up about 87 percent of the overall prison population, are in for drug crimes. So a focus on reducing prison sentences for other crimes, including violent ones, is likely needed to truly end mass incarceration.  And Obama’s clemency actions only captured a fraction of federal inmates. As of 2015, there were around 92,000 federal prisoners in for drug crimes, and more than 100,000 in for other crimes — far more inmates than Obama’s nearly 2,000 clemency approvals reached.  Even among drug offenders, Obama has reduced fewer prison sentences than the US Sentencing Commission did by reducing the recommended baseline for federal drug prisoners — a move that has already let out thousands of prisoners before their original release dates. And by commuting sentences rather than pardoning people, the president has released ex-prisoners into a world where their criminal records can still stop them from getting jobs, public housing, or the vote.  But most people would agree being out of prison without those things is still better than being in prison without them. The thousands of people who are waiting to hear about their commutations certainly believe that. So does the Obama administration.  The Trump administration likely will not.  President-elect Trump ran on a “tough on crime” platform. He indirectly attacked Obama’s attempts at clemency — and by “indirectly” I mean “exaggerated it to the point of lying,” excoriating Obama for releasing “thousands” of “violent criminals.”  Sessions, Trump’s nominee for attorney general, is likewise a crime hawk. He’s criticized Obama’s use of the pardon power as a violation of the “rule of law.” It’s extremely unlikely that he’s going to turn around, once in office, and continue a policy that he vocally opposed.  Some criminal justice reformers have urged Obama to commute sentences for whole categories of prisoners, to make the biggest possible impact before turning the executive branch over to people whose views on criminal justice are so different from his own. Others have just urged him to get through the stack of applications at the pardon office quicker.  Obama did the second, but it didn’t go in the way reformers would like — it’s resulted in thousands of rejections. And it now seems clear he won’t do the first. Obama will leave office having helped nearly 2,000 individuals — but will leave many more languishing behind bars."

story1: "Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) says it's "just not worth it" to attempt to impeach President Donald Trump.  She told the Washington Post, "Unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path, because it divides the country."  Still, Pelosi doesn't think Trump deserves to be president. "Are we talking ethically? Intellectually? Politically? What are we talking here?" she said. "All of the above. No. No. I don't think he is... I mean, ethically unfit. Intellectually unfit. Curiosity-wise unfit. No, I don't think he's fit to be president of the United States."  Reaction from fellow Democrats on Pelosi's rejection of impeachment is mixed. Some believe there isn't enough evidence against the president or public support for impeachment. Others aren't giving up their push to impeach him.  New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told the Washington Examiner that she disagrees with the speaker. She believes Pelosi's view could change if something is revealed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.  And other members of the party already think the president should be investigated and impeached. Last week, House committees led by Democrats launched a series of new investigations against the president.  Anti-Trump lawmakers like Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) are saying they will not give up their attempts to impeach Trump. Waters is the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee which is probing Trump's finances.  "The Constitution gives us the authority and the responsibility to decide whether a president is acting in the best interest of his country... I believe we have everything needed to basically impeach Trump," Waters recently stated on MSNBC.  She recently tweeted: "For the faint of heart, who've been waiting for every "t" to be crossed and every "i" to be dotted, now is the time to demonstrate your patriotism. Support impeachment!"

"Today, I announced that later this month, I will be introducing a resolution to have the Judiciary Committee move on investigating grounds for impeachment. Our democracy must be protected," she tweeted recently.

MSNBC's Chris Matthews said, "Some argue that the push for impeachment (of President Trump) is ahead of schedule. I think a stronger argument can be made it's behind schedule.""
story2: "WASHINGTON — Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who has played down talk of impeachment for months, ratcheted up her objections to trying to remove President Trump from office in an interview published on Monday.  “I’m not for impeachment,” Ms. Pelosi told The Washington Post Magazine in the interview, which was conducted last week.  “Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country,” she added. “And he’s just not worth it.”  Ms. Pelosi has repeatedly made her aversion to impeachment clear in the past. But her remarks to The Post were more expansive than previous ones and are likely to irk some liberal rank-and-file members of Ms. Pelosi’s party trying to build support for it. Her remarks echoed the longstanding position of the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, who has said he does not want to move forward with impeachment unless he has substantial Republican support."

(Nathan Howard/Getty Images)  2 Charged With Voter Fraud, Allegedly Submitted 8,000 Fraudulent Registration Applications  Two men were arrested and charged in Southern California on voter fraud charges after they allegedly submitted thousands of fraudulent voter registration applications on behalf of homeless people, said the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office on Tuesday.  Carlos Antonio De Bourbon Montenegro, 53, and Marcos Raul Arevalo, 34, were charged with one count each of conspiracy to commit voter fraud, eight counts of voter fraud, four counts of procuring and offering a false or forged instrument, and other charges, said the DA’s office in a news release.  The office said Montenegro allegedly submitted more than “8,000 fraudulent voter registration applications between July and October 2020.” He’s also accused of falsifying names, signatures, and addresses on nomination papers “under penalty of perjury to run for mayor in the city of Hawthorne.”  Montenegro also faces another 10 counts of voter fraud, seven counts of procuring and offering a false or forged instrument, two counts of perjury, and five misdemeanor counts of interference with a prompt transfer of a completed affidavit, the office said.  If convicted, Montenegro can face as many as 15 years and eight months in prison, while Arevalo could face seven years in prison, officials noted.  The FBI, District Attorney’s office, the Los Angeles Public Integrity Division, and other agencies are investigating the case.  Other details about the case are not clear. It’s also not clear if their alleged voter fraud scheme affected the presidential election in some way.  It’s not clear if either Montenegro or Arevalo have lawyers.  According to local news outlet The Daily Breeze in a report in August, Montenegro, who was running for mayor in Hawthorne, had “turned in paperwork to run for mayor but failed to meet the required 20 signatures by Hawthorne residents.”  Over the past two weeks, since the Nov. 3 election, President Donald Trump’s campaign and other Republicans have raised questions about voter fraud and irregularities that may have tipped the presidential race to Democratic candidate Joe Biden. The president’s team has filed several lawsuits in key states including Pennsylvania, Georgia, and other places, while citing sworn statements made by hundreds of witnesses.  The Department of Homeland Security’s cyber-security division, in a statement last week, said the past election was the “most secure” in history. Meanwhile, secretaries of state have disputed Trump’s claims of fraud.  However, the chairman of the Federal Elections Commission (FEC), Trey Trainor told Newsmax several days ago that he believes “that there is voter fraud taking place in these places.” Trainor, in a tweet, said a recent claim from Trump lawyer Sidney Powell about his team being able to overturn the election with their cases should be taken seriously."

story1: "The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 12-0 to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court despite the Democratic members of the panel boycotting the hearing.  The nomination will now move to a full Senate vote on Monday.  Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said Thursday he will not allow Democrats to derail the Judiciary Committee’s confirmation vote for Barrett after they made good on their threat to boycott the hearing.  “We’re not going to allow them to take over the committee,” Graham said in his opening statement. “They made a choice not to participate after allowing Judge Barrett four days to be questioned.”  “That is a choice they are making,” he continued. “I believe it does a disservice to Judge Barrett, who deserves a vote, up or down.”  President Trump hailed the vote to approve his nominee to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  “Judiciary Committee approves Judge Barrett. Moves to full Senate for final vote. Big day for America!,” he said on Twitter.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said Wednesday that members of his party would not take part in the confirmation vote because of how Republicans handled her nomination.  He called it “the most rushed, most partisan and least legitimate process in Supreme Court nomination history.”  The New York Democrat added that the Democrats would “not provide the quorum that is required,” referencing a Senate rule requiring members of the opposite party to be present to conduct government business.  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) described the hearing room empty of the panel’s Democratic members as a “surreal environment.”  “Our Democratic colleagues announced they are going to boycott one of the most important votes this committee will have probably during our entire senatorial tenure,” he said. “That is a vote to confirm, to provide advice and consent to a nominee of the Supreme Court of the United States.”  He then looked around the room, where some of the Democrats had left blown-up photos of ObamaCare recipients in their places.  “I just want to comment on the pictures that are in their chairs, like this is some sort of sporting event during COVID-19 and rather than show up and do their job, they choose to continue this theater.”  Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) also lambasted Democrats for refusing to appear for the vote.  “It is a shame that our colleagues on the other side, having failed to lay a glove on Judge Barrett, have walked out on this process and in so doing, walk out on the American people,” he said.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has pledged to allow the full Senate to vote before the Nov. 3 election.  Barrett joining the court would give conservatives a 6-3 majority."
story2: "Republicans on the Senate judiciary committee voted unilaterally Thursday to advance Amy Coney Barrett’s supreme court nomination to the full Senate despite Democrats’ refusal to sit in the hearing room for what they called a naked “power grab”.  Democratic senators had announced the night before that they would not participate in any move to install Donald Trump’s third supreme court nominee even as tens of millions of Americans vote in a presidential election less than two weeks away.  No supreme court nominee has ever been installed so close to a presidential election, and just four years ago the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and Senator Lindsey Graham, who now chairs the judiciary committee, said that installing such a nominee in an election year would be a shameful defiance of the will of voters.  Those qualms were nowhere in evidence on Thursday as Republicans, who hold a majority in the Senate and thus on every committee, met with themselves to send Barrett toward a seat vacated with the death last month of liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  “My Democratic Senate colleagues and I boycotted the supreme court nominee committee vote today,” Democratic vice-presidential nominee and California senator Kamala Harris tweeted. “Let’s be clear: this nomination process is a sham and shows how Republicans will stop at nothing to strip health care from millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions.”  Senators plan to convene a rare weekend session for procedural actions ahead of a final confirmation vote expected Monday. McConnell has said he has the votes to confirm Barrett, whose arrival on the court would create an unassailable 6-3 conservative majority.  “Barrett deserves to be on the supreme court and she will be confirmed,” said Graham. Democrats, he said, “made a choice not to participate”.  Democratic senators on the committee spoke outside the Capitol later Thursday morning about what they said was a broken process demanded by a corrupt president and engineered by a Republican majority that had lost its way in a desperate attempt to hold onto power despite dwindling popular support.  “We are descending into the low ground, the quicksand of a power grab, that will go down in history as one of the darker days of this institution,” Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said.  In their committee room seats, Democrats arranged for posters to be placed of constituents they said had been helped by the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which they fear Barrett, 48, could help throw out in a case that begins oral arguments next month, amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Barrett is a conservative whose anti-abortion views and ties to groups that have publicly opposed same-sex marriage raised alarm among progressives, as well as her unwillingness to comment on the legality of voter intimidation or to promise to recuse herself from any case arising from the coming election.  05:10 Amy Coney Barrett: key moments from the supreme court confirmation hearings – video  Nan Aron, president of the progressive Alliance for Justice group, said Republicans had conducted “theater”, as opposed to a real hearing.  “Senate Republicans believe ‘advice and consent’ means performing the theatre of a hearing without scrutinizing the nominee in the least,” Aron said in a statement. “Amy Coney Barrett refused to answer the most fundamental questions about our democracy and human rights. Today’s vote shows Senate Republicans are already confident that she will advance their agenda.”  But Jeanne Mancini, president of the anti-abortion group March for Life, praised Barrett and compared her favorably to Ginsburg.  “Like her predecessor, Amy Coney Barrett is a trailblazer who is a role model for Americans,” Mancini said in a statement. “Her immense respect for the law and constitution will allow her to fairly apply the law and consider the rights of everyone who comes before her, including the unborn.”  Trump is on track to becoming the first president in decades to appoint three supreme court justices in just one term, and he has shattered records for the speed with which he has remade the judiciary, installing more than 200 federal judges with McConnell’s help.  Previous Trump nominees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh joined the supreme court in 2017 and 2018, respectively.  In her confirmation hearings, Barrett declined to say how she would rule in potential future challenges to the landmark Roe v Wade decision in 1973 that made abortion legal in the US, or other landmark reproductive rights cases.  But progressives and mainstream legal analysts said her views on those and other issues appeared to be extreme, and they expressed concern that she could participate in the dismantling of environmental regulations, voting rights law, anti-discrimination protections, protections for immigrants and other essential safeguards.  “It is an irresponsible and undemocratic abuse of power to see the Republican Senate leadership on the judiciary committee rush to fill Justice Ruth Ginsburg’s seat in the middle of an election and instead of providing coronavirus relief for the millions of families harmed by the pandemic and the economic crisis,” said Tina Tchen, president of the anti-sexual harassment group Time’s Up Now.  “This sham process is preventing the American public from understanding how her extreme views are out of step with our constitutional values and principles.”"

story1: "The pressure is building for NBC News’ Kristen Welker to address the ongoing scandal surrounding a laptop purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden and containing damning emails, texts and photos during Thursday night’s final presidential debate as the mainstream media has essentially dismissed the story.  "This is a moment of truth for Kristen Welker and NBC News, in which they are caught between doing their job or protecting Joe Biden,” Cornell Law School professor and media critic William Jacobson told Fox News.  FBI IN POSSESSION OF LAPTOP ALLEGEDLY BELONGING TO HUNTER BIDEN  The laptop, which was first brought to light in reports by the New York Post, contains emails suggesting Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden had knowledge of, and was allegedly involved in, his son’s dubious foreign business dealings.  The Post rocked the political world last Wednesday with an initial report that revealed a 2015 email Hunter Biden allegedly received from a member of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, who appeared to thank him for "giving an opportunity" to meet his father, then-Vice President Biden.  The former vice president had long claimed that he did not talk to his son about his business dealings, but evidence from the laptop seems to contradict that point. Additional allegations related to the laptop have since come out, including an email that appeared to detail a business arrangement involving a Chinese company and members of the Biden family.  NPR SLAMMED FOR DISMISSING COVERAGE OF HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP SCANDAL AS A 'WASTE OF TIME'  The email includes a note saying, “Hunter has some office expectations he will elaborate.” A proposed equity split references “20” for “H” and “10 held by H for the big guy?” with no further details.  "The reference to 'the Big Guy' in the much publicized May 13, 2017 email is in fact a reference to Joe Biden," Sinohawk Holdings CEO Tony Bobulinski, who was listed as the recipient, said in a statement to Fox News.  But much of the media has gone to great lengths to avoid reporting on the scandal, with Twitter and Facebook each coming under fire for censoring the Post bombshell and NPR even dismissing it as a waste of time.  The former vice president has snapped at the few reporters who dared to ask him about the scandal and CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS and MSNBC have all taken heat for their lack of coverage. But millions of voters will be tuned in Thursday as Welker moderates the final presidential debate in Nashville, giving her a chance to force the issue with Biden.  “To avoid or downplay the Biden family influence-pedaling scandal would both create additional claims of media bias and eliminate Welker as a serious journalist." — William A. Jacobson  “To avoid or downplay the Biden family influence-peddling scandal would both create additional claims of media bias and eliminate Welker as a serious journalist," Jacobson added.  HUNTER BIDEN BUSINESS PARTNER CALLS EMAIL 'GENUINE,' SAYS HUNTER SOUGHT DAD'S ADVICE ON DEALS  DePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall agrees that Welker should ask about the Hunter Biden “elephant in the room” or she would open herself up to “criticism that she's covering” for the Democratic nominee.  “Not because of what Hunter might or might not have done, but because of what Joe Biden's role might have been, or at least his awareness of what Hunter might have been doing,” McCall told Fox News.  “The mainstream media have steered away from this story, but the internet is churning it and it is surely on the minds of some voters," McCall continued. "This matter would fit surely into the category of leadership that Welker has on her topic list.”  Welker is choosing to focus on fighting COVID-19, issues facing American Families, race in America, climate change, national security and leadership, the Commission on Presidential Debates said earlier in October.  NBC News did not immediately respond when asked if Welker plans to ask about the controversy surrounding Hunter Biden.  RATCLIFFE SAYS HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP, EMAILS 'NOT PART OF SOME RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN'  Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe confirmed this week that the laptop “is not part of some Russian disinformation campaign," despite Democrats and liberal pundits suggesting otherwise.  “It would be absolutely disgraceful if Biden isn’t asked about the contents of the laptop." — Chris Barron  The story took another turn on Wednesday when documents obtained by Fox News and verified by multiple federal law enforcement officials suggested that the FBI’s subpoena of the laptop and hard drive came in connection with a money laundering investigation in late 2019. Much like the initial story, the money laundering investigation was largely ignored.  In a 12-hour span following the report, the words “laundering” and “launder” were not mentioned once on CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC or CBS, according to a search of closed caption archives.  “It would be absolutely disgraceful if Biden isn’t asked about the contents of the laptop. There are emails that implicate Joe Biden and he has -- to date -- not denied that these emails are real and accurate,” conservative strategist Chris Barron told Fox News.  TRUMP SLAMS DEBATE MODERATOR WELKER AS 'TERRIBLE,' 'TOTALLY PARTISAN'  “President Trump was asked about QAnon. If the media thinks that’s relevant then clearly the Biden emails are,” Barron said, referring to last week’s NBC News town hall event when Savannah Guthrie asked the president about the conspiracy theory.  Welker, who has a chance to end the mainstream media blackout of the brewing laptop drama, has already been criticized for ignoring foreign policy as a topic and Trump recently claimed she will be biased against him.  Trump said in a "Fox & Friends" interview Tuesday that he wished there would be a neutral party moderating the debate.  “Kristen Welker is terrible," Trump said. "I mean she is totally partisan; her father and mother are big supporters of Joe Biden for a long time. They're supporters of the Democrat Party, and she deleted her entire account."  CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP  The Biden campaign on Wednesday pushed back on the claims leveled against Hunter Biden, particularly those first reported by The New York Post last week.  Fox News' Brooke Singman, John Roberts, Ronn Blitzer and Evie Fordham contributed to this report."
story2: "The smear campaign against Kristen Welker—who is moderating Thursday’s second and final presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden—began last Saturday with a hit piece by Trump-friendly New York Post reporter Jon Levine.  “Kristen Welker, upcoming presidential debate moderator, has deep Democrat ties,” screamed the headline, while Levine insinuated that the longtime NBC White House correspondent, a registered independent, must not only embrace the same politics as her parents—generous donors to Democratic causes and candidates—but that she also allows her parents’ beliefs to steer her journalism.  The story, which ignored facts provided by NBC News which contradicted Levine’s thesis, falsely suggested that Welker, also a Weekend Today co-anchor, is a liberal partisan advocate who once “celebrated Christmas at the White House with the Obamas,” illustrated by a photo of Welker posing with Barack and Michelle Obama.  The innuendo that this was evidence of her Democratic Party loyalty was a brazen lie, as Levine must have known, since many New York Post and Fox News journalists, and even Bill O’Reilly and Rupert Murdoch, had attended various Obama White House holiday parties over the years—and even waited in the traditional receiving line to have their pictures taken with the president and first lady.  The story also featured a 2016 video in which Welker advised Hillary Clinton’s then-communications director Jennifer Palmieri on the topic of one of her questions (“I’m going to ask you about Flint,” she said) before a live TV interview—portraying as a seamy political scandal an innocuous and common courtesy from a television journalist to an interviewee.  Welker’s colleagues at rival media outlets also rallied to her defense. “If any other outlet started covering the political donations of *the parents* of folks who work at Fox there would be widespread outrage and rightly so,” CNN’s Jake Tapper tweeted about Fox News’ aggressive promotion of Levine’s story. “This is hideous and unjournalistic. And another example of how bad actors use standards against those who uphold them.”  Levine, whose reporting has become increasingly partisan since he moved to the Murdoch-owned tabloid from The Wrap last year, declined to comment to The Daily Beast. Among the facts he was aware of but ignored, according to a person familiar: that Welker and her husband, John Hughes, attended the 2017 media holiday party at the Trump White House; that New York Post reporters had attended every year of the Obama White House press parties; that Welker has been a registered independent since 2012; and that top Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller had praised Welker’s fairness.  While overlooking Miller’s assessment, Levine did manage to include this anonymous quote from a person he described as “senior White House official”: “Anyone who’s ever dealt with Welker knows she’s an activist, not a reporter. The White House press team views her the same way they would AOC or Pelosi if they walked in the office.”  As the Nov. 3 election rapidly approaches, the Post has become a clearing house for Trumpworld’s breathless opposition research dumps, such as the recent dubious yarn about the alleged contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop, provided to the tabloid by Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.  Welker is simply the latest target.  “If the corporate right’s goal was to gin up negative stuff on Kristen Welker in advance of the debate among their audiences and their voters, it worked,” said a media executive who asked not to be further identified. “It’s a case study of how effective the right-wing echo chamber is.”  Indeed, Levine’s work quickly burned its way through the Trumpist media echo chamber, jumping like a brushfire from Hot Air to The Blaze to The Washington Examiner to Donald Trump Jr.’s Twitter feed to Fox News to the 45th president of the United States.  “Kristen Welker is terrible,” Trump complained in a phoner to Fox & Friends on Tuesday. “I mean she is totally partisan. Her father and mother are big supporters of Joe Biden for a long time. They’re supporters of the Democrat Party.”  The president then compared the 44-year-old Welker unfavorably to C-SPAN’s Steve Scully, whose tweet seeking advice from Trump detractor Anthony Scaramucci—along with his college internships 42 years ago in Biden’s Senate mailroom and Sen. Ted Kennedy’s press office—provoked a barrage of attacks from Trump supporters; when Scully’s claim that his Twitter account had been hacked was exposed as a lie, the public-affairs cable network indefinitely suspended him.  “Kristen Welker is far worse than Scully,” Trump declared during an extended rant. “There are people out there that can be neutral. Kristen Welker cannot be neutral at all.”  The president’s attack—in sharp contrast to his praise for Welker in January when she got the Today show gig (“They made a very wise decision,” he congratulated her during a White House trip to Davos, Switzerland)—naturally elevated the smear to mainstream nonpartisan media outlets such as The Hollywood Reporter and Politico.  Trump’s condemnation of Welker also was at odds with the positive assessment of one of his top campaign aides, Jason Miller, who predicted in early October on Fox News that “she’s going to do an excellent job as the moderator for the third debate. I think she’s a journalist who’s very fair in her approach and I think that she’ll be a very good choice for this third debate.”  Not surprisingly, Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade eagerly joined in the Welker-bashing. “This moderator whose parents are Democratic, don’t they check who was a registered Democrat before, who has the most hostile questions possible to [White House press secretary] Kayleigh McEnany or whoever the press secretary is and the president? How does she get picked to be the moderator at this debate? It’s incredible… She is often the most abrasive, most dismissive reporter in all those briefings.”  Fox News star Sean Hannity, meanwhile, mounted a sustained assault during his Monday night show.  “We now have two Biden Democratic moderators in a row, first Scully and now apparently whoever this NBC person is, Kristen Welker, apparently is a big-time Democrat in pictures with her and Obama,” Hannity raged. “Team Trump is making one thing clear, if the moderator doesn’t make Biden answer the tough questions, the president will do it himself. Because we are also learning tonight just how partisan now and how in the tank the NBC News moderator is for Democrats.”  NBC News declined to comment on the controversy generated by the Trumpist propaganda machine. But a person who agreed to be identified as a source close to Welker told The Daily Beast: “I’m at a loss for words at the sheer desperation in trying anything to discredit her ahead of Thursday. Kristen Welker is likely the most straitlaced, even-tempered, respected and respectful journalists in the White House press corps. Her colleagues, the White House, and one of Trump’s most senior advisers, Jason Miller, all know it.”  Elsewhere, the New York Post—the originator of the Welker smear—isn’t taking lightly the criticism of its role as a Trumpist clearinghouse. In one instance, the Post appeared to directly retaliate against Twitter after it took measures against the tabloid for its “potentially harmful” content.  Last week, the social-media giant restricted the Post’s official account, saying the paper’s questionable story about Hunter Biden story violated its policies about sharing hacked material on the platform, and said the paper would need to remove tweets linking to the piece before the publication could regain access to its account.  The move was not well-received among the tabloid’s upper ranks. And so on Saturday, the Post seemed to hit back by publishing a separate story from Levine about some anonymous Twitter employees who expressed their dislike of Trump online.  A source familiar with the situation confirmed to The Daily Beast that back in June the Post was prepared to run a similar story, authored by Levine, listing many of the same anti-Trump tweets that eventually appeared in Saturday’s piece. The piece was mysteriously shelved for four months, only to be resurrected this weekend, just days after Twitter took action against the Post and its content.  —With reporting from Justin Baragona."

story1: "Hospitals are now to send all COVID-19 patient information to a Department of Health and Human Services database in Washington, D.C., through a new policy that is alarming health experts who say they are concerned that the information will be withheld from the public or politicized.  "Historically, CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] has been the place where public health data has been sent, and this raises questions about not just access for researchers but access for reporters, access for the public to try to better understand what is happening with the outbreak," said Jen Kates, the director of global health and HIV policy with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, in a comment to The New York Times. "How will the data be protected? Will there be transparency, will there be access, and what is the role of the CDC in understanding the data?”  The policy was posted in a document on the HHS website. Beginning Wednesday, the department and not the CDC will collect daily reports about patients, the number of available beds and ventilators, and other information on the pandemic.  The report said the change will streamline data gathering while helping the White House Coronavirus Task Force allocate supplies. However, the database is not open to the public, which medical officials fear will hinder researchers who rely on CDC data for projections and other decisions.  HHS spokesperson Michael Caputo, however, said the CDC's system is inadequate, but that the agency will still make data available to the public. However, he added, the CDC "has a week lag" in reporting hospital data, but the United States needs it in "real-time."  "The CDC, an operating division of HHS, will certainly participate in this streamlined all-of-government response. They will simply no longer control it," Caputo added.  The change came after a conference call between White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx and hospital executives. She said hospitals were not being adequate while reporting data and brought together a working group to devise the new plan."
story2: "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will "no longer control" the coronavirus data collection system from hospitals across the nation, a spokesman for U.S. Health and Human Services confirmed Tuesday night.  The New York Times reported earlier Tuesday that the administration had ordered hospitals to bypass the CDC and send all COVID-19 patient information to a central database in Washington beginning Wednesday, raising concerns from health experts that it will be politicized or withheld from the public.  Michael Caputo, assistant secretary for public affairs for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement to NBC News that it would be a faster system.  He said that the CDC has about a one-week lag in reporting hospital data.  "The new faster and complete data system is what our nation needs to defeat the coronavirus and the CDC, an operating division of HHS, will certainly participate in this streamlined all-of-government response," Caputo said. "They will simply no longer control it," he said.  Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak  The Times reported that the HHS database that will receive new information is not open to the public, which could affect researchers, modelers and health officials who rely on CDC data to make projections and decisions.  Caputo told The Times that the CDC would still make data public.  In the statement to NBC News, he said the CDC's data gathering once worked well but was inadequate today.  "The President’s Coronavirus Task Force has urged improvements for months, but they just cannot keep up with this pandemic," Caputo said. "Today, the CDC still provides data from only 85 percent of hospitals; the President’s COVID response requires 100 percent to report."  Critics have charged that President Donald Trump has sought to downplay the severity of the coronavirus pandemic and that he or members of his administration have encouraged states to reopen though the virus remains a threat.  Four former CDC directors or acting directors wrote an op-ed that appeared in The Washington Post Tuesday titled, "We ran the CDC. No president ever politicized its science the way Trump has."  Tom Frieden, Jeffrey Koplan, David Satcher and Richard Besser warned in the op-ed of "political leaders and others attempting to undermine the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."  They wrote that the Trump administration has cast public doubt on CDC recommendations and highlighted comments regarding the reopening of schools.  As of Tuesday, more than 3.4 million cases of the coronavirus illness COVID-19 have been confirmed in the United States, with more than 137,000 deaths linked to the disease, according NBC News' count.  Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak  The issue of opening public schools in the fall with cases on the rise in many states has been a source of controversy.  In recent days, Trump and his administration have pressed for schools to fully reopen, with the president claiming that Democrats want schools to stay closed to hurt his re-election chances.  In California, the state's two largest school districts, in Los Angeles and San Diego, announced Monday that classes will be online only at the start of the school year, citing "skyrocketing infection rates" of the coronavirus in their areas."

story1: "President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference at the White House, March 29, 2020. (Al Drago/Reuters)  The Trump administration’s guidelines for reopening the U.S. economy will give recommendations to state governments on when to relax business closures, effectively recognizing that the final decision rests with individual governors.  “The buck stops with the governors,” a senior administration official involved in development of the guidelines told the Wall Street Journal. During a conference call with several state governors on Thursday, Trump also emphasized that governors will have the authority to reopen local businesses when they see fit.  Advertisement  “You’re going to call your own shots,” Trump said, according to a person briefed on the call. “We’ll be standing right alongside of you and we’re going to get our country open.”  The guidelines for reopening the country detail steps that states should take to open businesses and schools depending on the severity of coronavirus outbreaks in different areas. The guidelines have the backing of senior health officials including Dr. Deborah Birx, response coordinator of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  Over the past week Trump has asserted that he has the ultimate authority to reopen state economies, even though all business and school closures were enacted by state governments.  “For the purpose of creating conflict and confusion, some in the Fake News Media are saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states, not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government…this is incorrect,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Monday. “It is the decision of the President.”  The comments received bipartisan pushback, including from Florida senator Marco Rubio.  “The Constitution and common sense dictates these decisions be made at the state level,” Rubio wrote on Twitter.  Send a tip to the news team at NR."
story2: "(CNN) President Donald Trump unveiled new guidelines on Thursday meant to help states loosen their social distancing restrictions, but in a retreat from his onetime claim of "absolute authority" to restart the economy, he told governors on an afternoon telephone call it was their decision on when and how to reopen.  "You are going to call your own shots," Trump said, according to a person familiar with the conversation. "I've gotten to know almost all of you, most of you I've known and some very well. You are all very capable people, I think in all cases, very capable people. And you're going to be calling your shots."  It was a turnabout from his Monday claim that "the President of the United States calls the shots" in how to ease restrictions that have kept most Americans indoors and forced closures of schools, restaurants, gyms and other businesses. And it was an indication that even as he tries to ease the country out of its virtual shutdown, Trump will place responsibility elsewhere should cases spike again.  As business leaders, lawmakers and governors warn persistent testing shortfalls could hamper any effort to reopen the country, Trump is pushing ahead with attempts to revive an economy moribund by the coronavirus pandemic. He said during his daily news conference the new guidelines amount to the start of the country's "rejuvenation."  "We're starting our life again," Trump said, even as it remains to be seen just how quickly any state returns to normal.  The new guidelines , meant to speed Trump's goal of restarting the country, won't be mandatory. Many governors have already extended restrictions into May or banded into regional collectives that will determine their own reopening plans. The newest consortium was created in the Midwest on Thursday by Democratic and Republican governors.  But Trump, eager to see a return to normalcy for housebound Americans, wants to provide at least a framework for how places can reopen despite warnings from all corners that testing capacity for coronavirus is still too small.  He said Thursday there were some states that, according to his new plan, could be ready to reopen tomorrow.  "If you look at Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota -- that's a lot different than New York, it's a lot different than New Jersey," Trump said.  New guidelines  In a document provided to all 50 US governors during an afternoon phone call and obtained by CNN, the White House spelled out a three-phase approach to easing restrictions that depends on meeting specific case count and hospital capacity thresholds.  The benchmarks for the first phase include a sustained decrease in cases over a 14-day period and a return to pre-crisis conditions in hospitals, according to the document.  States should have the "ability to quickly set up safe and efficient screening and testing sites," the guidelines read, and "quickly and independently supply sufficient Personal Protective Equipment" in hospitals.  The phased approach encourages all individuals to continue good hygiene practices like washing hands and to "strongly consider" using face coverings in public. And the document encourages employers to enact social distancing, temperature checks, testing and sanitation practices in their workplaces.  In the first phase of reopening, the document suggests schools that are currently closed should remain so and employees who are able to telework should keep working from home.  Large venues, including some restaurants, can operate under strict social distancing protocols. Gyms can open as long as they maintain social distancing guidelines, but bars should remain shuttered.  The guidelines still recommend minimizing nonessential travel, and indicate vulnerable populations should remain sheltered-in-place.  Phases two and three gradually decrease the recommended restrictions.  Trump unveiled the guidelines publicly at an early evening news conference.  "We are not opening all at once but one careful step at a time," Trump said, indicating each state could "tailor" its own reopening plan. "If they need to remain closed, we will allow them to do that."  In his call with governors, Trump previewed the plan but insisted it would be up to the individual governors to make the decision in their own states when they begin that process.  Trump said the decision to target May 1 as the day to begin the process of reopening the country came in consultation with Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx , medical leaders of the administration's coronavirus task force.  Trump described the two doctors' sign-off on May 1 date as a "negotiation."  "It was a little bit of a negotiation that that's the way it should be," Trump said. "I guess, I hope it is that way usually, but we all do want to see things open."  Birx described the guidelines as "fairly strict" in order to give states time to get testing and surveillance ready.  "That's to give states really the time to really set up exactly how they're going to contact trace with the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in the background as supporting," Birx said on CNN's Global Town Hall, "Coronavirus: Facts and Fears."  "I think those two pieces together, we really need to move forward over the next few weeks as the states move through, and really decrease the number of cases."  'Absolute authority' turns into not mandatory  Ahead of their release, officials said the new recommendations would mimic the social distancing guidelines the President announced in March and extended at the start of April: While not mandatory, they carry the weight of the federal government and the presidency.  Trump, who began the week insisting he had the "absolute authority" to reopen the country, retreated after pushback from Republican and Democratic governors alike. He said each state would submit a plan to him for reopening, though even that is not required.  Many states have already begun drafting plans on returning to normal, including consortia of states on the East and West coasts that have agreed on joint phased reopenings.  Ahead of Trump's phone call with governors on Thursday, a new collective of Midwestern governors said they were joining together to coordinate on reopening plans. The leaders of Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky -- both Democrats and Republicans -- said they would "work in close coordination to reopen our economies in a way that prioritizes our workers' health."  Many of those governors -- along with public health experts, lawmakers and business leaders -- say that without widespread testing, Americans won't be able to return to workplaces quickly because it will remain unclear who could still be spreading the virus.  In phone calls with members of the US House and Senate on Thursday, Trump was told by some lawmakers that without increased testing, asymptomatic people may return to workplaces and unknowingly spread further contagion, according to people familiar with the call.  Trump countered by saying his administration had worked to scale up testing and he repeated his dubious claim that the United States had tested more people than any other country.  He also pointed to a new test that people could administer themselves that uses saliva, a person familiar with the conversation said.  It was a similar message to one he received a day earlier during a phone call with some members of his newly formed business advisory council. In that conversation, industry leaders reiterated what public health experts and governors have been telling Trump for weeks: that there would need to be guarantees of ramped-up coronavirus testing before people return to work, according to one person briefed on the discussions.  As they weigh new guidelines on reopening the country, White House officials have pored over data on testing availability and hospital capacity, hoping to more narrowly devise a strategy to improve testing capacity where it still lags.  Trump said Wednesday it was governors' responsibility to improve testing in their state, shrugging off responsibility for enacting the type of nationwide testing system he was touting only last month.  "We want the states to administer these tests, for the most part," he said. "We want them to do it, we're not going to be running a parking lot in Arkansas."  Different regional rules  Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said Wednesday there were nine states with fewer than 1,000 cases each who may be the first to lift distancing restrictions. Trump said he believed there could be nearly 30 states in "extremely good shape," and repeated his assertion that certain places may be able to reopen sooner than May 1.  But even among the nine states with the lowest case counts -- Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, Nebraska, North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Alaska and Hawaii -- not all governors have expressed an eagerness to quickly reopen. Some, such as North Dakota, still appear to be experiencing an increase in cases, meaning their peaks could be weeks away.  Before Trump unveiled the new guidelines, he spent the day on phone calls with foreign leaders and lawmakers. In a teleconference with other G7 leaders, Trump faced resistance to his decision to halt US funding to the World Health Organization.  Trump has claimed the WHO is overly weighted toward China and made grave mistakes early in the coronavirus outbreak, a stance he reiterated on the morning videoconference. But other leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, sought to bolster the global health body as essential during the pandemic.  "Much of the conversation centered on the lack of transparency and chronic mismanagement of the pandemic by the WHO," the White House said in a readout of the conversation. "The leaders called for a thorough review and reform process.""

story1: "Actress Alyssa Milano speaks at a protest outside the White House, July 17, 2018. (Mary F. Calvert/Reuters)  Only some women are to be believed, when it’s politically convenient.  It’s one thing to adopt a poorly formed set of principles and foist them on others at every opportunity. It’s another to apply those principles unflinchingly to one’s political opponents while giving allies a free pass.  Celebrity Alyssa Milano — who is famous now mostly for having once been famous — has lately become an expert in this sort of hypocrisy, as she has cashed in her social-media currency to become a useless fixture of our increasingly useless political debates.  Advertisement  Unlike most of our cultural icons, she has declined to use her Twitter and Instagram accounts to fill our feeds with mind-numbing but bearable drivel about nontoxic beauty products, green smoothies, and high-intensity workouts. Instead, she has chosen to become a champion of myriad progressive causes and a star in the vast constellation of anti-Trump celebrities.  One of her more memorable crusades in recent memory was on behalf of failed 2017 Democratic congressional candidate Jon Ossoff, who attempted to win an open seat in a Georgia district in which he didn’t reside. But perhaps her most vocal campaign has been as a self-fashioned leader of the #MeToo movement. In this role, she has often invoked the ill-conceived “believe all women” principle by which we are required to reflexively assume that every woman who alleges sexual harassment or assault is telling the truth.  During the lengthy smear campaign against Brett Kavanaugh — in which the nominee’s ideological opponents attempted to tank his confirmation by entertaining unsubstantiated allegations of sexual misconduct — Milano became one of the most vehement anti-Kavanaugh voices.  Advertisement  When one of Kavanaugh’s accusers, Christine Blasey Ford, gave her public statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Milano attended the hearing, sitting well within view of the C-Span and network cameras. She was there, she said, “to show support for Doctor Ford, to stand in solidarity with other women, other survivors that have been through similar experiences.”  “If professor Christine Blasey Ford is to be believed, and I believe she is, Brett Kavanaugh is a sexual predator,” Milano wrote in a CNN op-ed in October 2018. In one tweet at the time, she shared a statement from discredited Kavanaugh accuser Debbie Ramirez. In another, she wrote:  It’s was just confirmed to me by @MichaelAvenatti that the @FBI has NOT yet reached out to him about his client Julie Swetnick. They have reached out to Deborah Ramirez and her representatives. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) September 29, 2018  Apparently, she thought that the FBI should “reach out” to Michael Avenatti and Julie Swetnick, who, without witnesses or evidence, accused Kavanaugh of vicious sexual crimes.  Since the dawn of the #MeToo movement, Milano has presented herself as a consistent advocate for women, staunchly refusing to survey the available evidence in each accusation and instead mechanically adopting the position that accused men are always guilty.  No longer. In the wake of sexual-misconduct allegations against Joe Biden, whom Milano has endorsed for president, the #MeToo maven appears to have discovered the long-forgotten notion of due process.  Advertisement  In an interview yesterday afternoon, Milano explained her decision to continue endorsing Biden, even as she defended her position of believing women’s testimony, saying that “for so long, the go-to has been not to believe them.”  “We really have to sort of societally change that mindset to believing women,” she continued. “But that does not mean at the expense of giving men their due process and investigating situations, and it’s got to be fair in both directions.”  Of the accusation against Biden, Milano went on to say, “I did my work and I spoke to [anti–sexual harassment group] Time’s Up, and I just don’t feel comfortable throwing away a decent man that I’ve known for 15 years in this time of complete chaos without there being a thorough investigation.”  In a Twitter thread last week after one of the accusations emerged, Milano wrote, “I respect Lucy Flores’ decision to share her story and agree with Biden that we all must pay attention to it. But, just as we must believe women that decide to come forward, we cannot assume all women’s experiences are the same.”  Advertisement  #MeToo activist and Harvey Weinstein accuser Rose McGowan harshly criticized Milano for her defense of Biden. While McGowan deserves criticism for embracing the “believe all women” mantra and dispensing with due process, she’s right to note the insincerity on display when activists such as Milano apply those principles only when it’s politically convenient.  Milano’s pro-due-process statement on the accusations against Biden is, in essence, the correct one, just as Biden’s recent defense of himself was justifiable. Due process is an essential part of the liberal legal tradition and a foundational part of our culture; there’s nothing wrong with invoking “innocent until proven guilty” on one’s own behalf or that of a friend. There is, however, quite a bit wrong with invoking this principle only when it suits you and jettisoning it when it comes to people holding political beliefs you find abhorrent."
story2: "Actress and activist Alyssa Milano sparked backlash on Twitter when she defended Democratic candidate Joe Biden despite the fact that his former staffer Tara Reade came forward with assault allegations.  Milano had previously received criticism for her silence regarding Biden’s harassment allegations, so she explained on a radio interview with Andy Cohen that she was skeptical that Reade’s statements were credible.  “I’ve been very vocal for Biden and my support for him and I did do my due diligence because part of it was that Times Up decided not to take the case, and so…I did my work, and I spoke to Times Up and I just don’t feel comfortable throwing away a decent man that I’ve known for 15 years in this time of complete chaos without there being a thorough investigation,” she told Cohen.  “I’m sure that mainstream media would be jumping all over this as well… if they found more evidence,” she added. “So, I’m just kind of staying quiet about it, and because I’m kind of staying quiet about it…”  “You’re getting dragged on Twitter by Bernie Bros,” Cohen interjected.  After the interview, Milano took to Twitter to add that believing women “does not mean everyone gets to accuse anyone of anything and that’s that.”  #BelieveWomen does not mean everyone gets to accuse anyone of anything and that’s that. It means that our societal mindset and default reaction shouldn’t be that women are lying. (Keep reading) — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) April 6, 2020  The actress quickly received criticism on Twitter from both liberal and conservative figures.

story1: "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced overnight that she plans on taking measures to potentially curb President Trump’s ability to conduct military operations against Iran.  Pelosi and other Democrats have been critical of Trump’s decision to conduct an airstrike in Iraq that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' elite Quds Force, claiming he did not properly notify Congress in advance and warning about the risk of escalation in the region. Trump has also threatened additional action if Iran retaliates for Soleimani’s death.  TRUMP NOTIFIES CONGRESS OF WARNING AFTER LAWMAKERS SAID THEY WEREN'T INFORMED ABOUT SOLEIMANI IN ADVANCE  “This week, the House will introduce and vote on a War Powers Resolution to limit the President’s military actions regarding Iran,” Pelosi wrote in a letter to fellow Democrats, referring to a similar Senate resolution to be introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. “It reasserts Congress’s long-established oversight responsibilities by mandating that if no further Congressional action is taken, the Administration’s military hostilities with regard to Iran cease within 30 days.”  The first War Powers Resolution was passed in 1973 in an effort to prevent presidents from using the military without congressional approval. Since then, questions of presidential compliance have become common, with controversy stemming from President Bill Clinton’s actions in Kosovo and President Barack Obama’s operations in Libya.  On Saturday, the White House sent Congress formal notification of the drone strike under the War Powers Act, a senior administration official told The Associated Press. The notification, required by law within 48 hours of the introduction of American forces into an armed conflict or a situation that could lead to war, had to be signed and sent to Congress.  TRUMP WARNS IRAN: US HAS TARGETED ’52 IRANIAN SITES’ AND WILL ‘HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD’ IF NEEDED  The document sent Saturday to congressional leadership, the House speaker and the Senate president pro tempore was entirely classified, according to a senior aide for the Democrats and a congressional aide speaking to the AP.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., also sent a letter to the president Sunday asking him to fully declassify the notification, claiming that “there appears to be no legitimate justification” for keeping it secret.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Trump tweeted Sunday afternoon that “legal notice is not required” for him to take additional action, but claimed that his online posts provided notification to Congress that he “will quickly & fully strike back, & perhaps in a disproportionate manner” if Iran attacks “any U.S. person or target.”  Iran has vowed to retaliate and avenge the death of Soleimani. Iranian officials also announced they would be abandoning the 2015 nuclear deal, signaling threats of further nuclear proliferation.  Trump had tweeted Saturday that even Iran’s cultural sites were potential targets for U.S. military action. "They're allowed to kill our people. They're allowed to torture and maim our people. They're allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people, and we’re not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn't work that way," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday.  Earlier that day, Iraqi lawmakers approved a resolution calling to expel U.S. troops from the country, who were sent there more than four years ago to aid in the fight against the Islamic State terror group.  Fox News’ Frank Miles and Vandana Rambaran and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
story2: "Washington (CNN) House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday sent a letter to Democratic members of Congress announcing the House will introduce and vote on a "War Powers Resolution to limit the President's military actions regarding Iran" amid rising tension.  The resolution, Pelosi writes, "reasserts Congress's long-established oversight responsibilities by mandating that if no further Congressional action is taken, the Administration's military hostilities with regard to Iran cease within 30 days."  The letter comes as the US is deploying thousands of additional troops to the Middle East following the airstrike that killed Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani. Earlier Sunday, President Donald Trump reiterated his threat to target Iranian cultural sites.  "Last week, the Trump Administration conducted a provocative and disproportionate military airstrike targeting high-level Iranian military officials. This action endangered our servicemembers, diplomats and others by risking a serious escalation of tensions with Iran," Pelosi writes.  Pelosi said the resolution would be led by Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, who previously worked for the CIA and was an analyst for the Defense Department specializing in Shia militias.  Read More"

story1: "All 34 cadets from the West Virginia Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation who posed in a class photo raising their hands in a Nazi salute will reportedly be fired, the state’s governor announced Monday.  Gov. Jim Justice’s decision followed a state probe that found the class had been giving Nazi salutes since early on in their five-week training, according to a summary of the probe obtained by the Charleston Gazette-Mail.  However, the report also said there was no racist intent from the cadets because they did not fully grasp the gesture’s historical meaning.  Three academy staff were axed and four instructors were suspended without pay following an investigation by the state Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety into the photo from “Basic Training Class #18.”  The controversial picture, which was released earlier this month, contained the text “Hail Byrd!” — and one cadet during the course of investigation said the salute was a way to pay homage to their instructor, Karrie Byrd, the report said.  Byrd, though, claimed to investigators she was unaware of the gesture’s significance, believing it was just a greeting.  Her comments run counter to some of the investigative findings.  Explaining to a secretary what the cadets were doing in the photo, Byrd allegedly said: “That’s why they do that, because I’m a hardass like Hitler.”  The instructor allegedly “encouraged it, reveled in it, and at times reciprocated” the Nazi salute, the probe found.  Byrd was determined to be the one who took the class photo, retaking it several times because 10 of the cadets did not participate in the Nazi salute until she ordered them to, the report said.  Investigators determined that the picture was “highly offensive and egregious in appearance,” according to the summary of the findings.  But, the probe found, the cadets did not harbor any malicious intent and their actions weren’t discriminatory in nature.  DMAPS Director Jeff Sandy, who headed the investigation, chalked up the cadets’ behavior in the photo to “ignorance” — even though some class members admitted to investigators they recognized its “historical implications” and refused to participate.  “The investigation showed there was no white supremacy, no neo-Nazi, just ignorance,” he told the paper. “I guess you can say that’s the silver lining.”  Brian Abraham, Justice’s top attorney, declined to comment to the paper about the non-discrimination findings.  A DMAPS spokesman told the paper Monday the department is “awaiting guidance from counsel and leadership” regarding the release of the full report."
story2: "West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said Monday he has approved the recommendations from a report calling for the firing of all correctional officer cadets who participated in a Nazi salute during a class photo.  The photo of Basic Training Class 18, released by the state's Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety on Dec. 5 with the employees’ faces blurred, shows about 30 uniformed trainees posing with their right arms raised, most of them with their hands also extended. The words “Hail Byrd!” also appear at the top of the image.  Three people — two academy trainers and a cadet — were fired days after the photo was released and 34 others suspended without pay amid the investigation by the department and its Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation.  According to the investigation summary, the use of the gesture began two to three weeks into training as one that the cadets have described as a "sign of respect" for an individual identified as "Instructor Byrd."  Byrd told investigators she was unaware of the “historical or racial implications of the gesture” and reported it was “simply a greeting," according to the report. But her statement was contradicted by multiple sources, the report released Monday says.  Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics  "The investigation disclosed that she encouraged it, reveled in it, and at times reciprocated the gesture," the report states. "Additionally, Byrd appeared to overrule the corrective actions taken by others and assured the cadets the behavior was acceptable."  The class photos, including the "Hail Byrd'' picture, were forwarded to a member of the secretarial staff as is standard procedure. A secretary reported asking Byrd, "What are you all doing in the picture?" Byrd told her "there is nothing wrong with it, we have people of all colors and backgrounds in the picture and every one of them are participating."  The secretary stated that Byrd directed her to caption the picture "Hail Byrd," according to the report, and told the secretary the students say that “because I’m a hard-ass like Hitler.”  The report recommends the termination of an additional academy staff member who failed to report the content of the class photo, suspension without pay for four academy instructors who are currently “known to have seen the photograph and failed to report its content or to have witnessed ... this conduct and while making attempts to stop it, failed to take the necessary steps to report the conduct."  The report states some cadets "only followed what they perceived to be an order from Instructor Byrd to do the 'Hail Byrd' for the photograph because they feared they would not graduate, or would be disciplined for failure to follow the order of a superior."  Still, the report continues, "their conduct, without question, has also resulted in the far-reaching and harmful perceptions that are the antithesis of the values we strive to attain."  The salute not only damaged the reputation of the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation but "also negatively impacts morale across the workforce," the report states.  The governor said in a statement released Monday that he had reviewed the factual information regarding the incident that was provided by Jeff Sandy, the West Virginia Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety's secretary, and had approved all of the recommendations.  “I expressed my thanks to him and the entire department for quickly getting this report done," Justice said.  “As I said from the beginning, I condemn the photo of Basic Training Class 18 in the strongest possible terms," Justice said, adding that "this act needed to result in real consequences — terminations and dismissals."  The governor also reiterated an earlier statement that this kind of behavior will not be tolerated on his watch in any agency of state government.  “We have a lot of good people in our Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety," he said in his statement. "But this incident was completely unacceptable. Now, we must continue to move forward and work diligently to make sure nothing like this ever happens again.”"

story1: "U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday took aim at President Emmanuel Macron over the French leader's criticism of NATO and criticized the other members of the military alliance for being too slow to beef up their defense budgets.  As prime ministers and presidents of the 29-member alliance converged on London for a summit marking NATO's 70th birthday, Trump told reporters Macron's comments were "very nasty" when he lamented the "brain death" of the organization due in large part to a lack of U.S. leadership.  "Sometimes he'll say things that he shouldn't say," Trump said. "Sometimes I think he does things that are counterproductive for his own country."  During campaigning for the last election, Trump described NATO as "obsolete." He has since tempered his criticism somewhat.  Relations between the U.S. and France are particularly strained this week after the U.S. Trade Representative proposed introducing tariffs on $2.4 billion in goods in retaliation for a French tax on global tech giants including Google, Amazon and Facebook. Trump and Macron are due to meet on the sidelines of the summit.  Discussing military funding, Trump noted that "a lot of countries haven't paid."  After Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, NATO countries halted their post-Cold War spending cuts and began increasing spending. They pledged to "move toward" spending 2% of GDP on their national defense budgets by 2024.  "You could make the case that they've been delinquent for 25-30 years," Trump said after talks with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. He added that the figure of 2% "is a very low number, it really should be 4."  Stoltenberg, given the unenviable task of trying to hold NATO together as its leaders take pot shots at each other, said that "we're doing more together, North America and Europe, than we have done in many decades."  European allies and Canada are forecast by the end of this year to have increased defense spending by $130 billion since 2016. NATO predicts they will be spending $400 billion more by 2024.  The summit in London comes amid a series of spats between leaders that threatens to expose a lack of unity that could well undermine the military organization's credibility.  Macron insisted ahead of the meeting that the endless spending debate should be set aside so that NATO can focus on important strategic questions like who its enemies really are, how to improve ties with Russia and what to do with an unpredictable ally like Turkey.  In turn, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has lashed out at Macron, and the very public arguments bode ill for a summit hosted by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is deep into an electoral campaign and desperately wants to smooth things over.  Ankara raised the ire of its allies by invading northern Syria, and for buying Russian air defense systems with powerful computers aboard that suck up data and would compromise the military equipment of allies if they were stationed nearby.  Before heading to London, Erdogan suggested that Turkey might not back Poland and NATO's Baltic allies — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — should they require defending unless the allies support Turkish concerns about Syrian Kurdish fighters, which Ankara sees as terrorists.  That threat raises new questions about NATO's commitment to its collective defense clause — Article 5 — under which all allies vow to come to the aid of a member under attack. The clause has only ever been activated once, after the 9/11 attacks in the United States.  The two-day summit kicks off late Tuesday with receptions at Buckingham Palace and Downing Street. One short working session will be held at a golf resort in outer London on Wednesday. The aim is to issue a joint declaration — if the summit can survive the friendly fire.  Trump is due to hold separate talks with Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte on the sidelines of the summit. Johnson is also set to host talks on Syria with Macron, Merkel and Erdogan later Tuesday."
story2: "The dramatic moment, which came as both leaders were in London to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the NATO alliance, underscored how a relationship formerly known for lingering hugs, lint-brushing and white-knuckle handshakes has devolved over divisions on matters ranging from terrorism to trade policy.  This time, the deterioration took place on live television.  “The president doesn’t like confrontation in person and doesn’t quite know how to react to being on the receiving end,” said Heather A. Conley , director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Macron understands that. He’s decided the best defense is offense.”  Throughout the day, Mr. Trump made news on a number of fronts in his scattershot way, speaking to reporters for over two hours in total. He castigated Democrats as “unpatriotic” for supporting a possible impeachment, commented on Prince Andrew’s relationship with the disgraced financier Jeffrey A. Epstein — “tough story,” Mr. Trump said of the prince, whom he claimed not to know — and mused that he might punt on a trade deal with China until after the 2020 election.  But it was Mr. Macron who was his focus for much of the day.  In November, Mr. Macron — another leader who enjoys talking — made headlines for lamenting, in an interview with The Economist magazine, what he said was the loss of American leadership, leading to “the brain death of NATO.” He said the United States under Mr. Trump appeared to be “turning its back on us,” notably by pulling troops out of northeastern Syria without notice, and called on Europeans to do more in their own defense with the aim of “strategic autonomy.’’  “You have no coordination whatsoever of strategic decision-making between the United States and its NATO allies,” Mr. Macron said. “None.”"

story1: "Billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg ended weeks of speculation — marked by a stunning mea culpa for his past defense of ‘stop and frisk’ — and formally declared himself a Democratic candidate for the White House on Sunday.  The media mogul, New York City’s last three-term mayor, declared to supporters in a launch video and statement, “I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America. We cannot afford four more years of President Trump’s reckless and unethical actions.”  “He represents an existential threat to our country and our values. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage. The stakes could not be higher. We must win this election. And we must begin rebuilding America. I believe my unique set of experiences in business, government, and philanthropy will enable me to win and lead,” said Bloomberg, who had ruled out a presidential run as recently as March.  He faces a tough fight to win the nomination over top tier Democratic candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders who have been campaigning for months, including five debates.  Bloomberg will enter tied for fifth place, polls show.  But Biden’s debate stumbles coupled with the unexpected strength of the twin far-left candidacies of Warren and Sanders left Bloomberg and his advisors worried Democrats could select a nominee unable to beat President Trump next fall, sources told The Post.  His advisors believe the mogul’s $52 billion fortune and willingness to self-fund means he can catapult himself into contention.  The ad released online and airing in key battleground states starting Sunday is part of the three-term New York mayor’s $34 million initial ad campaign announcing his candidacy.  “He could have just been the middle-class kid who made good but Mike Bloomberg became the guy who did good,” said a tweet linking to the video with the logo Mike Bloomberg 2020. “After building a business that created thousands of jobs, he took charge of a city still reeling from 9/11. A three-term mayor who helped bring it back from the ashes, bringing jobs and thousands of affordable housing units with it.”  He also trumpeted his work advocating for gun control measures and efforts to fight climate change.  It said the 77-year-old will “restore faith in the dream that defines us where the wealthy will pay more in taxes and the middle class get their fair share. Everyone without health insurance can get it, and everyone who likes theirs, keep it.”  The ad concludes: “Jobs creator, leader, problem-solver.”  Bloomberg’s official declaration follows two stunning reversals — and apologies — from the famously stubborn politician as he plotted his entry into the race.  The first came when he apologized for sexist remarks he made while leading his eponymous Midtown media empire through a spokesman.  His second, made in person last Sunday, stunned the city — reversing his decade of unquestioned public support for the NYPD’s controversial ‘stop-and-frisk’ policy that was ruled unconstitutional and fueled a political backlash that elected his successor, Mayor de Blasio.  Political experts said Bloomberg had to make the move to square his politics with the shifting debate across the country — and in the Democratic Party — over criminal justice and policing.  “Why did he do it? Bloomberg knows that to compete for the nomination he has to get a chunk of the African-American vote,” University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato told The Post. “It’s that simple. If you can’t compete for the black vote you might as well save your money.”  He added: “You’ve got to stop people from booing you. He wants to say, `I apologize for that but this is what I did for the African-American community.”  That wasn’t Bloomberg’s only political maneuvering in the run-up to Sunday’s announcement.  He nabbed ballot spots in two states with early registration deadlines, Alabama and Arkansas.  The online advertisements Bloomberg is funding target four states expected to be hotly contested during the 2020 election: Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.  On his campaign’s website Sunday, the billionaire Bloomberg highlighted an economy that is “tilted against most Americans,” a health care system that “costs too much and doesn’t cover everyone,” communities “ravaged by gun violence,” and a global climate crisis that is “growing worse by the day.”  Bloomberg also described a “cruel and dysfunctional” immigration system, schools that are failing students in an “increasingly high-tech world, and special interest groups that “corrupt” Washington and “block progress on all of these issues.”  Then addressing Trump by name, he said he challenged the president on gun violence and “won stronger gun laws in states across the country” and “took on Trump the climate denier.”  “I know what it takes to beat Trump, because I already have. And I will do it again.I’ve never shied away from a tough fight,” he said on the campaign site. “Defeating Trump – and rebuilding America – is the most urgent and important fight of our lives. And I’m going all in.”  Bloomberg recounted how his father never earned more than $6,000 in a year, and how his parents instilled in him and his sister the need for an education. He also reflects on being laid off at 39 and coming up with an idea to start a company – “so I took a chance.”  “Today our company employs 20,000 people and generates large profits, almost all of which go to helping people across the country and around the world. I’ve always believed in investing in our employees and treating them well. We pay employees very well and provide the best health care benefits money can buy. And if someone has a baby, they get six months of paid leave,” he said.  And noting how he was elected mayor of New York weeks after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, he wrote: "
story2: "Michael Bloomberg has finally decided to run for president, after a years-long game of will-he-or-won’t-he.  On Sunday, the 77-year-old billionaire philanthropist, media magnate, and former New York City mayor officially announced he will campaign to win the White House in the Democratic primary. Earlier this month, rumblings began that Bloomberg would finally pull the trigger after he started to register to get on the ballot in multiple states. He further fueled speculation when he apologized on November 17 for his mayoral administration’s stop-and-frisk policy, after declining to do so for years.  It’s been a long road to get here. In March, Bloomberg said he wouldn’t run for president. He also publicly ruled out an independent bid back in 2016. But now, he’s going to go for it after all.  “I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America,” Bloomberg said in a Sunday statement. “We cannot afford four more years of President Trump’s reckless and unethical actions. ... If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage.”  In the face of the rise of progressive candidates like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and the perceived weakness of former Vice President Joe Biden, Bloomberg appears to be tossing his hat in the ring as a moderate alternative. Though he switched his affiliation back to the Democratic Party in 2018 after years as a Republican and independent, that doesn’t mean he’s all-in on the progressive issues other Democrats are embracing, as I noted earlier this month:  He is a champion of gun control and addressing climate change, but he has criticized Medicare-for-all as unaffordable and said Warren’s proposed wealth tax is likely unconstitutional. He has expressed optimism about the Green New Deal and said all of the concepts in it deserve consideration, but warned that it should not put forth “things that are pie in the sky.” He is viewed as a more Wall Street-friendly, centrist candidate.  Bloomberg’s run hasn’t been met with, say, the most open arms among the Democratic base. A Morning Consult poll conducted soon after the Bloomberg buzz started earlier this month found that just 4 percent of Democratic primary voters would pick the former mayor as their first choice to be the party’s nominee, behind Biden, Sanders, Warren, Pete Buttigieg, and Kamala Harris. In a head-to-head poll with President Donald Trump, Bloomberg did have a lead over the current president, as did Warren, Sanders, and Biden.  Other candidates have criticized Bloomberg over weighing entering the race and held him up as another example of a billionaire trying to exert too much influence over politics, as Riley Beggin laid out for Vox:  Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was campaigning with one of his key surrogates — Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — in Iowa, told supporters, “You’re not going to buy this election by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on media in California.” Ocasio-Cortez later told reporters, “They’ve got class solidarity. The billionaires are looking out for each other. They’re willing to transcend difference and background and even politics.” And Sanders echoed that sentiment, saying, “Jeff Bezos, worth $150 billion, supporting Mike Bloomberg, who’s worth only $50 billion, that’s real class solidarity.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has called for taxing assets over $1 billion at 6 percent, also skewered Bloomberg following reports of the call, writing on Twitter, “One billionaire calls another billionaire and asks him to run for president — I’m shocked!” She also linked to a wealth calculator showing how much billionaires would pay under her proposed wealth tax (there’s a button where visitors can choose to be Bloomberg, among others).  Biden told reporters prior to Bloomberg’s announcement that he has “no problem” with him getting into the race. “In terms of he’s running because of me, the last polls I looked at, I’m pretty far ahead,” he said.  Of course, not everyone was so turned off by the idea of a Bloomberg run — including, and perhaps especially, many of those in the same tax bracket. Hedge funder Leon Cooperman, who has been publicly feuding with Warren, told CNBC he would back his fellow billionaire. Recode’s Jason Del Rey reported that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos had put in a call months earlier to ask Bloomberg if he would make a White House run.  Ben White at Politico reported that many on Wall Street have an affinity for Bloomberg but were well aware his candidacy was a long shot, to say the least. White quoted one senior Wall Street executive saying it is “ridiculous” for him to think he can win the Democratic nomination. “I think he could wish on a star that the process is different,” the executive said. “But it’s not.”  Bloomberg’s presidential bid may have the opposite of the effect he intended — namely, boosting progressive candidates such as Warren and Sanders and eating up support from moderates like Biden and Buttigieg. Vox’s Matt Yglesias laid out the issue:  The key is that in recent years, moderates who’ve successfully fended off the left wing of the Democratic Party have done so with the support of black and Latino voters, who tend to be more moderate on the whole than white Democrats. But Bloomberg’s specific political career gives him little access to this constituency and thus little hope of securing the nomination. What he can do is compete with Biden (and to an extent Pete Buttigieg) for the votes of white moderates and thus further boost the left’s odds of prevailing.  It appears Bloomberg is ignoring the naysayers — and probably his own data and polling — and is giving it a go after all."

story1: "This story is from October 2019. Looking for more recent information? Find the latest news about power outages here.  The number of Southern California Edison customers whose power was turned off to try to prevent wildfires was going down steadily Thursday, but about 41,000 were still without electricity by evening.  About 223,600 customers live in areas where the utility said outages were being considered. Most of those areas are in or near mountains and passes where Santa Ana winds — and the danger that they could spread fires — are especially strong. Those winds were expected to gradually die down throughout the day Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.  Friday update: Southern California Edison power outages caused by wind are almost over  At the peak of outages in the early-morning hours of Thursday, about 84,000 customers were without electricity and well over 300,000 were in areas that faced that possibility, an Edison spokesman said.  On Thursday afternoon, he didn’t have an estimate for when the remaining customers would have power restored — it depends not just on the weather, he said, but also on crews being able to check lines and equipment to make sure there’s no damage.  Here are the areas in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties where Edison said it has cut electricity or was considering it as of 6:30 p.m. Thursday. (See the full list of affected communities, including in other counties, below the map.)

story2: "Californians are bracing for power outages throughout the state as utilities consider sweeping blackouts amid returning high winds.  Pacific Gas & Electric Co. announced Monday it could shut off power to 605,000 customers Tuesday and Wednesday in its latest bid to reduce the wildfire risk. That means well over 1 million people could lose power.  The counties are Alameda, Alpine, Amador, Butte, Calaveras, Contra Costa, El Dorado, Humboldt, Kern, Lake, Marin, Mendocino, Napa, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Shasta, Sierra, Siskiyou, Solano, Sonoma, Tehama, Trinity, Tuolumne, Yolo and Yuba.  Some shutoffs took place Tuesday morning.  Advertisement  That blackout would cover more than two dozen Northern California counties and would come just days after a much larger power shut-off that covered nearly 1 million customers over the weekend. That outage is believed to have affected more than 2 million residents in the Bay Area and other northern regions.  To the south, a forecast of more Santa Ana winds prompted Southern California Edison to say it could shut off power to more than 350,000 customers. Those shut-offs include Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Bernardino and Riverside counties.  The blackouts are a new and controversial tactic designed to prevent wind-driven brush fires caused by downed utility lines. Officials think the tactic is effective. But two major fires this month — the Kincade fire in Sonoma County and the Saddleridge fire in L.A. — may have been caused by downed power lines.  With the Kincade fire spreading, Santa Rosa residents were forced to evacuate in darkness early Sunday amid PG&E power outages, using flashlights and cellphones as light sources.  Advertisement  Elsewhere, businesses have closed, and plans have been canceled. Food has spoiled in refrigerators.  PG&E on Monday revealed it had failed to notify about 23,000 of its customers of precautionary power shutdowns earlier this month and also disclosed that its equipment malfunctioned near two fires that broke out in Contra Costa County on Sunday afternoon.  The utility identified the incidents in filings to the California Public Utilities Commission the same day the CPUC announced it would investigate how PG&E and other utilities handled shut-offs this year amid competing demands. Critics want PG&E to stop causing more wildfires, but the utility also has come under fire for the widespread blackouts, often without adequate notice to the public and vulnerable populations.  Advertisement  The utility de-energized lines to 729,000 of its customers between Oct. 9 and 12, but notifications were not sent to about 23,000 customers, including 500 with medical conditions, PG&E stated in a CPUC filing.  The utility failed to notify some people because, among other reasons, there was no contact information on file with the company or the customers were overlooked because of the shifting grid patterns that the utility was establishing, according to PG&E officials who declined to comment beyond what was stated in the report.  The company said it tried to reach customers who required power for medical equipment — known as medical baseline customers — through any means necessary, including phone calls, text messages, emails or knocks on the door.  Advertisement  “Of the 30,026 medical baseline customers impacted, PG&E verified 29,144 received notice prior to de-energization,” the report stated. “A total of 28,138 confirmed receipt of a notification, which included 5,080 door knocks. The medical baseline customers that did not confirm receipt of an automatic notification prior to de-energization had received multiple contact attempts.”"

story2: "National Review  At the outset of the pandemic, the government undertook a deliberate effort to reduce economic activity in what was widely thought to be a necessary measure to slow the spread of COVID-19. Whereas most recessions call for policy that stimulates the economy, the COVID-19 recession called for the opposite — measures that would enable workers and businesses to hit pause until a vaccine or therapeutic became widely available. Now that vaccines are being administered, policymakers face a different challenge — not keeping Americans inside, but getting them back to work as quickly as possible. In this context, President-elect Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package misses the mark. The proposal gives a nod to public health — with $20 billion allocated to vaccine distribution, $50 billion to testing, and $40 billion to medical supplies and emergency-response teams — but fails to address the most pressing hurdles to COVID-19 immunity. Vaccines sit unused not for lack of funding but thanks to burdensome rules determining which patients can receive shots and which doctors can administer them. Additional spending to speed up vaccine distribution is welcome, but its effects will be muted if bureaucratic hurdles remain in place. Even if the public-health provisions were to succeed in reopening the economy, much of the rest of Biden’s plan guarantees that it will reopen weaker. For one, an expanded unemployment-insurance top-up of $400 a week would mean more than 40 percent of those receiving unemployment benefits would make more off-the-job than on-the-job at least until September, and possibly for longer. The food-service and retail industries hit hardest by the pandemic would see the largest shortfalls in labor, exacerbating the challenges they’ve faced over the past year. Enhanced unemployment may have been reasonable when we wanted workers to stay home, but it’s catastrophic when we want them to go back to work. Meanwhile, Biden’s proposed minimum-wage increase to $15 nationally would eliminate an estimated 1.3 million jobs, hitting low-income states hardest. In Mississippi, where the median wage is $15, as many as half the state’s workers would be at risk. A minimum-wage hike may be high on the Democratic wish list, but it does not belong in an emergency-relief bill. The Biden plan isn’t all Democratic priorities, though. He took a page from Trump’s book and proposed $1,400 checks to households, bringing the second-round total to $2,000. With household income now 8 percent above the pre-pandemic trend, additional checks would do little more than pad savings accounts. Indeed, 80 percent of the recipients of last year’s checks put the money into savings or debt payments, not consumption. The flagship item in Biden’s plan would do little to spur economic growth even on Keynesian assumptions. The same goes for state and local aid, for which Biden is seeking $370 billion on top of $170 billion in public-education grants. The total of $540 billion far surpasses the roughly $50 billion hit to state and local tax revenues last year. As we wrote in December, states and cities are slow to spend federal grants, so the lion’s share of this stimulus would not show up until 2023. Rather than attempting to stimulate the economy, Biden is hoping to launder bailouts of profligate Democratic states through COVID-19 relief. Other parts of the bill — expansions of the earned-income and child-tax credits — are defensible long-term structural reforms, but as year-long emergency measures, they will have the same muted effect as direct checks. By including a slew of proposals unrelated to the pandemic, Biden has weakened his hand in negotiations and made it less likely that urgent measures pass quickly. In the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic policymakers rose to the occasion. Following an unprecedented external shock, the U.S. economy has emerged in relatively good shape, with less unemployment and bankruptcy than most feared. But the policies implemented to curb COVID-19 are not suited for what will begin to become, over the course of this year, a post-pandemic economy. Biden may have campaigned during a recession, but he is taking office during a recovery. He should govern accordingly."

story1: "Maryland Rep. Elijah E. Cummings died early Thursday at Johns Hopkins Hospital due to complications from longstanding health challenges, his congressional office said. He was 68.  A sharecropper's son, Cummings became the powerful chairman of a U.S. House committee that investigated President Donald Trump, and was a formidable orator who passionately advocated for the poor in his black-majority district, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore as well as more well-to-do suburbs.  As chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Cummings led multiple investigations of the president's governmental dealings, including probes in 2019 relating to the president's family members serving in the White House.  Trump responded by criticizing the Democrat's district as a "rodent-infested mess" where "no human being would want to live." The comments came weeks after Trump drew bipartisan condemnation following his calls for Democratic congresswomen of color to get out of the U.S. "right now," and go back to their "broken and crime-infested countries."  Cummings replied that government officials must stop making "hateful, incendiary comments" that only serve to divide and distract the nation from its real problems, including mass shootings and white supremacy.  "Those in the highest levels of the government must stop invoking fear, using racist language and encouraging reprehensible behavior," Cummings said in a speech at the National Press Club.  Cummings' long career spanned decades in Maryland politics. He rose through the ranks of the Maryland House of Delegates before winning his congressional seat in a special election in 1996 to replace former Rep. Kweisi Mfume, who left the seat to lead the NAACP.  Cummings continued his rise in Congress. In 2016, he was the senior Democrat on the House Benghazi Committee, which he said was "nothing more than a taxpayer-funded effort to bring harm to Hillary Clinton's campaign" for president.  Cummings was an early supporter of Barack Obama's presidential bid in 2008.  Throughout his career, Cummings used his fiery voice to highlight the struggles and needs of inner-city residents. He was a firm believer in some much-debated approaches to help the poor and addicted, such as needle exchange programs as a way to reduce the spread of AIDS.  Cummings was born on Jan. 18, 1951. In grade school, a counselor told Cummings he was too slow to learn and spoke poorly, and he would never fulfill his dream of becoming a lawyer.  "I was devastated," Cummings told The Associated Press in 1996, shortly before he won his seat in Congress. "My whole life changed. I became very determined."  It steeled Cummings to prove that counselor wrong. He became not only a lawyer, but one of the most powerful orators in the Maryland House of Delegates, where he entered office in 1983. He rose to become House speaker pro tem, the first black delegate to hold the position. He would begin his comments slowly, developing his theme and raising the emotional heat until it became like a sermon from the pulpit.  Cummings was quick to note the differences between Congress and the Maryland General Assembly, which has long been controlled by Democrats.  "After coming from the state where, basically, you had a lot of people working together, it's clear that the lines are drawn here," Cummings said about a month after entering office in Washington in 1996.  Cummings chaired the Congressional Black Caucus from 2003 to 2004, employing a hard-charging, explore-every-option style to put the group in the national spotlight.  He cruised to big victories in the overwhelmingly Democratic district, which had given Maryland its first black congressman in 1970 when Parren Mitchell was elected."
story2: "Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland died early Thursday due to complications stemming from longtime health issues, the Democratic leader’s office announced.* He was 68. Cummings, who has played a high-profile role in a myriad of investigations into President Donald Trump as the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, underwent a medical procedure last month but had not yet returned to his office this week when the House was back in session.  “A sharecropper’s son, Cummings became the powerful chairman of a U.S. House committee that investigated President Donald Trump, and was a formidable orator who passionately advocated for the poor in his black-majority district, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore as well as more well-to-do suburbs,” the Associated Press notes. “Cummings’ long career spanned decades in Maryland politics. He rose through the ranks of the Maryland House of Delegates before winning his congressional seat in a special election in 1996 to replace former Rep.

story1: "An Iranian oil tanker has been hit by two explosions off the coast of Saudi Arabia.  Tehran said a supertanker called Sabiti, owned by The National Iran Oil Company, was struck by two missiles 60 miles from the port of Jeddah around 5am Friday.  The explosions badly damaged two tanks on board the vessel, causing them to leak into the Red Sea.  'Experts believe it was a terrorist attack,' a source told Iranian news agency ISNA.  The blasts follows a series of attacks on tankers belonging to Saudi Arabia and its allies and on Saudi oil facilities which have been blamed on Iran.  Iran has not said who it believes is responsible for the attack on its tanker, though Riyadh will be top of its list of suspects.  Iranian supertanker Sabiti (pictured today) was hit by two explosions around 60 miles from the Saudi Port of Jeddah on Friday, as officials said it was hit by two missiles  The National Iran Oil Company, which owns the vessel, said the missiles had damaged the two main storage tanks on board the ship, causing them to leak into the ocean  The ship remained afloat after the attack and tacking data shows it has turned around and is heading back towards the Persian Gulf  The tanker is carrying 1million barrels of oil, and until Friday had not transmitted its location for 57 days. Iranian tankers often turn their trackers off to skirt US sanctions on exports  Iranian media said the blasts occurred around 5am and 5.20am local time  The Nour news agency, which is close to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, said the crew of the Sabiti was safe and had got the leak under control.  The state-owned National Iranian Tanker Company said that contrary to reports, 'there is no fire aboard the ship and the ship is completely stable'.  There was no word from Saudi Arabia on the reported attack and Saudi officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Lt. Pete Pagano, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet which is currently positioned near Iran, said authorities there were 'aware of reports of this incident,' but declined to comment further.  Iran has not said who it believes was responsible for the attack on the Sabiti.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said only that it was carried out by those committing 'dangerous adventurism.'  Mousavi said that the Sabiti was struck twice in the span of a half hour and an investigation was underway.  He added that Iranian tankers have been targeted by 'damaging activities' over recent months in the Red Sea, without elaborating.  Russia's foreign ministry has also said it is too early to assign blame for the attack.  Before Friday the Sabiti had not activated its transmitter for 57 days, when it was in the port of Bandar Abbas, but it suddenly began broadcasting its location again shortly after the blasts were reported.  Data shows the tanker is fully laden with 1million barrels of oil and is now heading back to the Persian Gulf with a destination of Larak, an island in the Strait of Hormuz.  It is unclear what the tanker's initial destination was. Iranian vessels often turn off their trackers to avoid US sanctions on oil exports.  Oil prices surged more than two per cent after the attack, with Brent surging 2.3 percent to $60.46, while West Texas Intermediate jumped 2.1 percent to $54.69.  The Iranian tanker was hit following months of tensions around the Arabian Peninsula which has seen attacks on tankers, drones and oil facilities  Friday's attack comes after a series of blasts targeting oil tankers belonging to Saudi Arabia and its allies, including on two vessels owned by Japan and Norway in June (pictured)  America has blamed for the attacks, releasing this image which Washington says shows the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps removing an unexploded mine from one of the tankers  Prices had already been rising on growing hopes for a breakthrough in the China-US trade talks.  It comes months after a series of attacks on tankers belonging to Saudi Arabia and its allies which were blamed on Iran.  In May four tankers - two belonging to Saudi Arabia, one to Norway and one to the UAE - were struck by explosions near the UAE in the Gulf of Oman.  An investigation by the UAE, America and France concluded that holes in the vessels were likely caused by explosive charges placed near the waterline.  The US said Iran was responsible for the attacks, though may not have directly carried them out.  That was followed by more attacks in June on two tankers, this time owned by Japan and Norway, in the same stretch of water.  America again accused Iran of being behind the attacks, saying an unexploded limpet mine was found on the side of one of the vessels.  The US also released footage which it claimed showed boats belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps returning to one of the ships after the blast to remove and unexploded mine.  The attacks led to spiralling tensions around the Gulf which saw Tehran shoot down an American Navy drone, which in turn almost led to the US bombing Iran.  President Trump ordered strikes against several IRGC bases, but called them off at the final moment.  Tensions rose further last month when a Saudi refinery - the world's largest - and oil field were hit by drones and missiles, which the kingdom said were fired by Iran  The explosions shut down 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of production - more than 5 per cent of global oil supply.  In May another four vessels were hit by explosions in the Gulf of Oman, in an attack that was also blamed on Iran. Pictured is the Norwegian Andrea Victory with a hole in its stern  Yemen's Houthi group claimed responsibility for the attacks, but a U.S. official said they originated from southwestern Iran. Riyadh blamed Tehran.  Iran, which supports the Houthis in Yemen's war, has denied any involvement.  Instability in the region was sparked when Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal, signed under Barack Obama.  The deal - which was also backed by European powers including Russia -had promised the regime economic benefits in return for curtailing its nuclear programme in a way that would stop it developing weapons.  Trump tore up the deal last year by reimposing crippling sanctions on Iran, prompting Tehran to stop complying with the deal by accelerating its enrichment of uranium and rebuilding stockpiles.  The President has said he wants to negotiate a new deal with Tehran, but Iran has refused to enter fresh talks, urging the US to return to the terms of the original deal.  While European countries have tried to establish economic measures to skirt the American sanctions, these have been largely ineffective.

(Photo by Allison Shelley/Getty Images)  (CNN Business) —  Reports of another attack on oil supply in the Middle East pushed prices higher early on Friday but the gains faded fast as markets focused again on weaker demand growth and a supply glut that shows no signs of evaporating.  The International Energy Agency said in its monthly report that commercial oil stocks held by OECD countries were close to record levels of more than 3 billion barrels, a level last seen in 2016. IEA member states hold an additional 1.6 billion barrels in strategic reserves.  At the same time, the IEA cut its forecast for oil demand growth this year and next due to the slowing global economy, and said a new wave of production was expected to come on stream, outweighing fears about supply security.  Iranian state news agency IRNA reported Friday that an oil tanker belonging to the National Iranian Oil Company had been hit by two missiles, causing oil to spill into the Red Sea.  The report immediately lifted Brent crude oil prices by 2% to above $60 a barrel — still well below the levels reached following a missile attack last month that wiped out half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production. US crude futures rose by a similar margin to nearly $55 a barrel. By 9.30 a.m. ET, they were up 0.9% at just over $54.  The attack on Saudi Arabia disrupted more than 5% of the global supply of crude, sending Brent crude prices as high as $70 a barrel.  But even then, prices quickly fell back to below the level they were trading at immediately before the attacks on reassurances from Saudi Arabia that normal operations would resume, the IEA said.  Friday’s reported attack on the Iranian tanker mattered more from a political perspective than in terms of supply, given that sanctions against Iran meant it had few buyers for its oil, said Richard Mallinson, a senior analyst at Energy Aspects.  Supply could be impacted if the attack provoked retaliation and tensions in the Gulf region escalated, Mallinson told CNN Business. For now, though, the underlying supply-demand balance was taking center stage. “The market is very worried about demand and the state of the economy. There is a perception that next year there will be too much supply around,” Mallinson said.  Supply growth from countries outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would accelerate next year, led by the United States, Brazil and Norway, the IEA said. It pegged non-OPEC supply growth at 2.2 million barrels per day in 2020, up from a previous forecast of 1.8 million.  Still, the renewed focus on demand and supply fundamentals did not mean that the Saudi attacks could be “shrugged off,” the IEA said. “Further incidents of this nature in the strategically important Gulf region could happen and cause even greater disruption,” it added."

story1: "House Democratic leaders are urging their colleagues to tone down the impeachment rhetoric as it relates to President Donald Trump.  During a Monday evening conference call, high-ranking party leaders tried to squash talk of pursuing impeachment at this time.  According to The Hill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others expressed their concern over jumping on the impeachment bandwagon without concrete evidence Trump might have committed an impeachable offense.  "We need to hear from [Attorney General William] Barr and [special counsel Robert] Mueller – and we need to see the unredacted report and the documents [that] go with it," House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said. "We cannot allow this president to continue going down this course."  Other lawmakers said it is time to pursue impeachment.  "I think we have great evidence that the president has blatantly violated so many laws. It's just ridiculous," Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., said, The Hill reported. "I think we have enough" to start the impeachment process.  According to CNN's Manu Raju, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said she is still in favor of impeaching Trump but she is not actively trying to recruit other members to join her effort.  Mueller recently completed his investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He did not find evidence Trump conspired with the Russians to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton, but he was unable to determine whether Trump obstructed justice.  Since a redacted version of the report was released last week, Democrats are pointing to evidence that shows Trump may have tried to interfere with Mueller's probe."

Confronted with a should-they-or-shouldn’t-they proposal on impeachment, Democrats worry that if they fail to learn history’s lessons, they are doomed to repeat them.  As they held a conference call to consider the Mueller report on Monday, party leaders in the House tried to resist falling into the same trap as Republicans who tried to oust President Bill Clinton and paid a heavy short-term political price.  They also stepped up their post-Mueller investigations by subpoenaing President Donald Trump’s former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify in their investigation into whether the President obstructed justice, even as Trump sued to block another committee from accessing his financial records.  But while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemed to tamp down plans for impeachment during the conference call, some Democratic presidential candidates sharpened their arguments at CNN’s town halls Monday night for moving forward with impeachment proceedings.  Polls show most Americans don’t favor an impeachment battle and immovable support for Trump among his base, so many Democratic lawmakers are buying into the conventional wisdom that impeachment could consign them to the same fate as 1990s Republicans.  But a longer-term look at the fallout from Clinton’s impeachment in 1998 may tell a different story than Democrats now seem to be remembering.  It’s true that House Republicans performed poorly in the midterm polls in the middle of Clinton’s impeachment drama and that the 42nd president left office with unusually high approval ratings.  But less than two years after Clinton escaped with his job from a Senate impeachment trial, Republicans won the presidency after using the outgoing president’s morals to underpin their campaign.  The other modern presidential election with an impeachment overhang, in 1976, also saw the incumbent party lose to a candidate – Democrat Jimmy Carter – implicitly running against scandal. Two years after Richard Nixon left office before he could be impeached over Watergate, Carter won the White House after capturing the anti-Washington mood by telling Americans, “We just want the truth again.”  History offers contradictory examples for Democratic leaders, such as Pelosi, who has her own memories of impeachment as a rising star of the 1990s and held the conference call with her members on Monday to discuss next steps.  Of course, the overriding question should be whether the actions of a President demand impeachment because they meet the constitutional bar of high crimes and misdemeanors, not whether the process could bring partisan advantage.  “There are some decisions that are bigger than politics,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts recently said, invoking loftier motives even as she sought a political payoff by becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to call for Trump’s impeachment after the Mueller report.  Warren consolidated her argument in a CNN town hall meeting in New Hampshire on Monday night.  “There is no political inconvenience exception to the United States Constitution,” Warren said. “If any other human being in this country had done what’s documented in the Mueller report, they would be arrested and put in jail.”  Another Democratic candidate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, adopted a similar position to Warren at the same town hall event, amid growing differences between 2020 hopefuls and Democratic leaders in the House.  “I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment,” Harris said.  Another 2020 contender Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont called for an “objective” investigation in the House but warned that constant impeachment talk could distract from Democratic priorities like health care, raising the minimum wage and tackling climate change.  No case to answer  Trump’s defenders argue that Mueller’s failure to establish conspiracy between the President’s 2016 campaign team and Russia and lack of a decision on whether Trump obstructed justice mean that impeachment would be a frivolous and unjustified process. Some are also warning Democrats they would face a backlash if they go ahead.  After Mueller’s effort revealed Trump’s pattern of lying and use of his presidential power to thwart investigations, few Democrats question whether Trump deserves to be impeached. But the debate is turning not on the question of Trump’s guilt but on whether Democrats think impeachment is a smart political idea.  One Democratic argument from before the release of the redacted Mueller report last week is that Democrats would play into Trump’s hands by impeaching him. The Senate GOP majority would protect the President from conviction in an impeachment trial and the process would unify Republicans and electrify Trump’s 2020 base.  Advocates of this position point to what happened when the Republicans impeached Clinton in 1998. In the subsequent midterm elections, Democrats bucked historic trends and picked up five seats, a shock win that contributed to Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich losing his job.  The result was seen as a referendum on Republican overreach after Clinton was impeached for committing perjury and obstruction of justice following a scandal arising out of his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. It also suggests to some 21st-century Democrats what can happen when a party puts an attempt to destroy a presidency before issues that voters most care about.  “With President Clinton, the impeachment proceedings became a proxy for the election,” Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts told CNN’s Dana Bash on Monday. “(Clinton’s) popularity went up. Some of it was sympathy, some of it was the facts that people saw that impeachment proceeding as a proxy for his worthiness for being elected.”  “If the next two years becomes about impeachment instead of about judging the President on his first term. … I think it may play into President Trump’s hands for reelection,” he said.  Polling may support Lynch’s position since there is no data that suggests the Mueller report is the top issue for voters on either side of the political divide.  Given the polarization of the Trump era, Mueller’s conclusions are also unlikely to change the voting preferences of the most committed partisans. Maybe it’s not worth risking the votes of anyone left in the shrunken political middle ground with a long impeachment drama.  The evidence of the 2000 election does suggest that there is precedent for draining months of scandal and high-profile congressional investigations to have a detrimental impact on the party holding power.  In the 2000 presidential election, Republican nominee George W. Bush – who branded himself as an outsider despite his presidential lineage – repeatedly vowed to restore “honor and dignity to the White House” as he jammed the Democratic nominee – Vice President Al Gore – over Clinton’s behavior.  The tactic played on voter fatigue of eight years of Clinton scandals, including the impeachment saga, internal White House controversies and allegations of illegal fundraising – and even the ethics questions that swirled around Gingrich and other Republicans.  But the message’s potency lay in its deft, implicit reference to impeachment. Bush used the attack to leave Gore with an unpalatable choice of renouncing the man he hoped to succeed and carrying the can for his improprieties.  “If he’s got a problem with what went on in the past, he ought to explain what it is,” Bush told reporters in 2000 in a clear reference to the Lewinsky scandal.  In the end, Gore was never able to find a way to benefit from Clinton’s popularity and to insulate himself from lingering questions about his morality and Bush won a disputed election that was eventually settled by the Supreme Court.  Impeaching Clinton did not hurt the GOP in subsequent elections either, since the party outperformed in the 2002 midterms and retained the presidency in 2004, though the dynamics of those two elections were largely shaped by the trauma of 9/11.  One difference in the current scenario is that the scandal-tainted President is expected to be on the ballot himself in 2020 – and Trump has shown a staggering capacity to sidestep even the most damaging political scandals.  While red state senators would love to save Trump in a Senate trial, such a vote would be politically damaging for Republican senators up for re-election in presidential swing states  Impeachment may not be ‘worth it’  But many top Democrats seem to have made up their minds on impeachment even before the redacted Mueller report was released last Thursday.  Pelosi said earlier this year that such a step was “not worth it,” and her deputy Steny Hoyer told CNN last week that the best way to deal with Trump was to beat him in an election.  While they want to avoid the worst risks of an impeachment saga, Democrats also want to reap the benefits of Mueller’s unflattering account of Trump’s behavior.  For now, they are pursuing a hybrid approach by holding a series of high-profile hearings with eye-catching witnesses and probing the President’s alleged obstruction.  In many ways this is going through the motions of impeachment without the end result, in an attempt to frame a case to voters that Trump is unfit to serve a second term.  “While our views range from proceeding to investigate the findings of the Mueller report or proceeding directly to impeachment, we all firmly agree that we should proceed down a path of finding the truth,” Pelosi wrote in a letter to colleagues on Monday.  “It is also important to know that the facts regarding holding the President accountable can be gained outside of impeachment hearings,” she added.  Pelosi doesn’t have the luxury of waiting for history’s verdict as she plots the Democratic strategy over the next 18 months until Election Day.  If she chooses to avoid impeachment and Democrats put a new president in the White House, she will be vindicated. But if Trump wins reelection despite the choking cloud of scandal around his White House, Democrats may question why they didn’t try to mortally wound him politically when they had the chance."

The solid job gains that have come to define the current economic expansion resumed in March. The gain in hiring, though widely forecast, will clear some of the doubts hanging over the economy. Though the economy is expected to slow this year from the strong pace of 2018, Friday’s report was a welcome sign that job creation remains robust. The United States economy is still enjoying one of its longest expansions on record. It has produced nearly 21 million jobs since the labor market bottomed out in 2010, and the unemployment rate has plunged from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009. (NYT)  “It’s clear that the U.S. economy is continuing to go to work for America’s small businesses and their millions of employees,” said Alfredo Ortiz, Job Creators Network president and CEO. “While the healthy job creation numbers reported this morning are a good sign the economy still has fuel in the tank, one of the other encouraging indicators is wage growth—which has performed extremely well over the past eight months.”  “The progress seen in the economy continues to surprise many onlookers,” continued Ortiz. “But with the sound policies being implemented by the Trump administration, there’s no telling where the marathon of strong economic growth will end. Not only has the administration cut taxes for millions of Americans and small businesses, but thanks to a reduction in burdensome regulations, businesses are able to operate more freely. Moreover, important initiatives in the workforce development area are being pursued and will help equip Americans with the necessary skills to fill one of the millions of available jobs. ”"

NEW YORK, NY - OCTOBER 05: A now hiring sign is displayed in the window of a Brooklyn business on October 5, 2018 in New York, United States. Newly released data by the Labor Department on Friday shows that US employers added 134,000 jobs last month. While this was below economists expectations of 185,00, it brought the unemployment rate down to 3.7 percent, the lowest since December 1969. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)  (CNN Business) —  American hiring rebounded last month after an unusually weak job market in February, but signs still point to a gradual economic slowdown.  The US economy added 196,000 jobs in March, up from 33,000 the prior month. Despite a slight upward revision from the original estimate, February hiring remained the weakest since September 2017.  Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remained at 3.8%, a level near historic lows.  While March hiring was robust, it brings the first-quarter average to 180,000 jobs created per month, down from 223,000 per month on average in 2018. Economists have been expecting a slowdown, and so far it looks gradual enough to support the idea that the economy may glide to a lower level of activity in 2019 rather than shudder to a halt.  “Markets are looking at every shadow and around every corner, whether it’s an inverted yield curve or bad jobs report,” said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Forecasting. “This should assure people that the boogeyman isn’t hiding in the closet.”  Another anemic month of job growth may have prompted the Federal Reserve to consider an interest rate cut later this year, after years of trying to raise rates back to a “neutral” level; this report is unlikely to push them in that direction.  Also reassuringly, the unemployment rate for African Americans dropped back to 6.7%, after rising to 7% from its lowest point ever back in May 2018.  The report did have one disappointing number, though: Wages, which economists had expected to grow at 3.4% over the year, and instead came in at 3.2%. Sustained periods of low unemployment are supposed to fuel fatter paychecks as employers struggle to fill positions, but this average hourly earnings number suggests the tight labor market isn’t accelerating that effect.  “Overall, nothing here to shift the dial very far in either direction. But the gradual slowdown in trend employment growth is another sign that the economy is weakening,” Capital Economics Chief US Economist Paul Ashworth wrote in a note to clients.  Also, manufacturing hiring slowed again after having been on a tear for the last year and a half. The sector lost 6,000 jobs in March, concentrated largely in the auto and auto parts sector — after adding only 1,000 in February, and both hourly and weekly earnings dropped slightly. Global manufacturing weakness and mounting tariffs have started to take a toll on the industry, and the shuttering of a General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio certainly didn’t help.  Retail, which abruptly stopped growing in January 2017 and then trended sideways, dropped another 12,000 jobs in March.  According to the household survey, which comes from a smaller sample, the unemployment rate only remained steady because the labor force shrank slightly more than the number of jobs. If that trend continues, it may show that those who remain on the sidelines of the labor market have structural barriers to joining it, such as care responsibilities or transportation challenges.  And in yet another sign that hiring is cooling off, the median number of weeks that people remain unemployed, at 9.6 weeks, has been ticking up in recent months, suggesting that people aren’t finding jobs as quickly as they used to after a layoff.  A measure that never recovered to its pre-recession high, the share of prime-age people who are working, also moved in the wrong direction in March, declining slightly to 79.8%."

story1: "The United States has gotten closer to reaching a deal with the Taliban that could lead to a withdrawal of U.S. troops in the region, President Donald Trump’s special envoy for Afghanistan peace said Monday.  American and Taliban officials agreed on the framework of a deal that includes U.S. forces leaving the area in exchange for a pledge from the Taliban that their territory in Afghanistan would not be used by them or other terrorist groups to harm the U.S. or its interests, The New York Times reported.  The Taliban must also agree to a cease-fire and direct talks with the Afghan government, two concessions the Taliban has long resisted.  “We have a draft of the framework that has to be fleshed out before it becomes an agreement,” Zalmay Khalilzad, the United States’s chief negotiator told the Times in Kabul, Afghanistan. “The Taliban have committed, to our satisfaction, to do what is necessary that would prevent Afghanistan from ever becoming a platform for international terrorist groups or individuals.”  Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who hasn’t been as involved in talks between the U.S. and the insurgents, called on the Taliban in a televised address Monday to “begin serious talks” with his government so all parties can reach peace.

(RELATED: The 5 Americans Lost Overseas In One Week)  Khalilzad’s statement came after six days of talks between U.S. envoys and Taliban officials in Qatar, and moves the needle closer to a peace deal that would end 17 years of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan.  2/3.

As for the Taliban, officials issued a statement Saturday saying that while progress has been made, “until the issue of withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan is agreed upon, progress in other issues is impossible.”  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the talks “encouraging news” in a Saturday tweet, adding that “The U.S. is serious about pursuing peace, preventing [Afghanistan] from continuing to be a space for international terrorism & bringing forces home.”  “Working with the Afghan gov’t & all interested parties, the U.S. seeks to strengthen Afghan sovereignty, independence & prosperity,” Pompeo added.

story2: "America’s nearly two-decade war in Afghanistan may finally be drawing to a close.  After six days of negotiations in Qatar last week, the United States and the Taliban, the country’s Islamic insurgent group, have reportedly agreed on the outline of a long-sought deal which would allow US and foreign troops to leave the country, perhaps within 18 months.  If true, this would officially kickstart the end to Washington’s involvement in Afghanistan, and likely hand much of the country back to the Taliban — a group which has outlasted the efforts of three US presidents to destroy it.  On Monday, the Trump administration’s envoy for the peace talks, Zalmay Khalilzad, told the New York Times that “[w]e have a draft of the framework that has to be fleshed out before it becomes an agreement.”  That framework as it stands now looks like this: The Taliban, which controlled Afghanistan and harbored al-Qaeda prior to the September 11 attacks, would promise never to allow a terrorist organization to operate in the country again. In return, at least some US troops would leave the country after the Taliban agrees to a ceasefire and engages in talks with the Afghan government.  That’s a potential problem: The Taliban has for years refused to engage with Kabul, but also hinted that it might do so only after foreign troops leave the country.  Asked about Khalilzad’s comments to the Times and other similar reports, a State Department spokesperson told me that “[w]hile discussions were positive, the talks concluded without an agreement.”  “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,” the spokesperson added.  Still, some experts I spoke with called the tentative outline a “breakthrough” and “tremendously good news” — and it is, to a certain extent. It’s the first, and possibly best, chance for the US to establish a semblance of peace between the US-backed government in Kabul and the Taliban so American troops can come home.  But major concerns remain, experts tell me. Namely, it’s unclear that the Taliban would actually adhere to such an agreement. Most signs indicate the insurgents are winning the war; the Taliban has taken much of the country’s territory back from Afghan control, and has recently pulled off attacks that kill hundreds of Afghans and even American service members. That’s led some to say the diplomatic effort is really a cover so the US can withdraw its forces — a priority for President Donald Trump — while avoiding embarrassment.  What both champions and critics of the US-Taliban talks told me, though, is that there’s still a long way to go before a final deal is within reach. “There’s at least five or six moving pieces here,” Jason Campbell, who led the Pentagon’s Afghanistan peace talk efforts from June 2016 to September 2018 and now at the RAND Corporation, told me. “If one goes wrong, you’re back to square one.”  Why a US-Taliban deal in Afghanistan is so hard to strike  To understand why US-Taliban talks aren’t easy, you need to understand the recent history.  The Taliban took control of Afghanistan in the early 1990s, and by 1998 controlled around 90 percent of the country. The group imposed its strict interpretation of Islamic law on the country: men had to grow long beards, women were forced to cover themselves completely, and people were prohibited from watching movies or listening to music. Punishments for various crimes sometimes included public executions or amputations.  After September 11, 2001, the US started paying closer attention to the group. US officials suspected the Taliban of harboring Osama bin Laden, who orchestrated the 9/11 attack, and his terrorist group, al-Qaeda. Less than a month after the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, the US invaded Afghanistan to defeat al-Qaeda and remove the Taliban from power.  The Taliban quickly lost control of Afghanistan and retreated into neighboring Pakistan, where it has since regrouped. Now, over 17 years later, the Taliban is the most formidable insurgency fighting the United States and the Afghan government — and it doesn’t look like its more than 60,000 fighters are going anywhere any time soon.  That’s because the Taliban is actually winning the war against the Afghan military, which is backed by roughly 14,000 American troops in the country. Two charts from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, the US military’s Afghanistan war watchdog, make this clear.  The first chart shows that the Taliban and other insurgent groups now control more populated areas than they did in August 2016. The second shows that insurgent groups control even more districts in Afghanistan than they did in January 2016, and their influence is growing.  This has made it hard for the US to reach some kind of peace deal with the Taliban despite nine years of trying (the Trump administration tried again in earnest as recently as last August.) Basically, the Taliban doesn’t seem to want to make concessions because it currently has the upper hand in the war.  That’s given the US less power to compel the insurgents to speak with the Afghan government, which the Taliban derides as an American puppet with little control outside the capital. The Trump administration says the only way for the war truly to end requires the Taliban and the government in Kabul to negotiate a peace deal.  Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, for his part, has repeatedly expressed a desire for Taliban talks. He reiterated that stance in a Monday address after receiving a briefing from Khalilzad on last week’s negotiations. But Ghani doesn’t want to rush discussions, he noted, saying that a bad deal could lead to bloodshed in the future and make life worse for the people of Afghanistan — particularly the women and minorities who suffered greatly under Taliban rule.  It would still be a major sign of progress if the Taliban ultimately agreed to meet with the Afghan government. The problem is that the most difficult part — ironing out the specifics of an Afghanistan-Taliban deal — would come next.  Why a deal between the Taliban and the Afghan government is so hard to strike  Experts I spoke to noted a variety of potential problems that could impede an Afghanistan-Taliban deal, and all of them said such a deal could take months to years to make. The issues break down into roughly two categories: how much power the Taliban gets to have, and what America’s future role will be.  Let’s look at each one.  1) How much power does the Taliban get?  In the short term, this is likely the biggest sticking point.  The Taliban wants to govern the country again like it did prior to the US-led invasion in 2001. It therefore aims to obtain as much power as it possibly can in any potential deal.  Some ways it could do that might include taking control of certain government ministries, or even rewriting parts of the country’s Constitution to align more favorably with its conservative Islamist ideology. The Taliban may also push for a deal whereby the government controls the capital and other populous areas while the Taliban takes over parts of the country’s east and south — areas it controlled even at the height of the war.  Finally, and controversially, Taliban fighters could even integrate into the Afghan military. That’d be hard to swallow for many, as the group has killed thousands of Afghans and Americans. It’s unclear if the US would continue to fund or support Afghan forces if Taliban militants join their ranks.  Either of those possibilities would give the Taliban way more authority over the state than it has now.  One idea Ghani, the Afghan president, and the Taliban have already rejected is to form an interim government, where the insurgent group’s leaders would temporarily join the administration and allow talks to continue. The Trump administration and Ghani, though, say elections are the only way to have a democratic and representative government in Kabul.  Ironically, a vote could complicate the talks. Afghanistan will hold a presidential election in July, and as of now there’s no clear front-runner. No candidate, especially Ghani, will want to look like they will make any concessions to the Taliban. That means it’s less likely the government and the militants can find a mutually agreeable arrangement before then.  The insurgents don’t have a candidate in the election, in part because they know they can’t win. “The Taliban represent a small fraction of the Afghan population,” Frances Brown, an Afghanistan expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told me. “Afghan society in 2019 looks very different from Afghanistan in the 1990s.”  But all of the talks assume one thing: that the security situation in the country remains about where it is — and that depends heavily on US involvement.  2) What is America’s future role in Afghanistan?  Trump has made no secret of his desire to remove US troops from Afghanistan. After months of pushing back against his advisers, the president reluctantly sent 3,000 more service members into the country in September 2017, upping the total to 14,000. He’s now considering cutting that number in half this year, although there’s no indication of an imminent announcement.  Still, the open talk of withdrawal has led to some to speculate the Trump administration would back even a minimal agreement so the military can rush out the door. “Kabuki theater is what this is,” Bill Roggio, an expert on Afghanistan at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies think tank, told me.  Roggio added that a withdrawal now, or at least talk of it, would harm any negotiations the Afghan government has with the Taliban. The insurgents could simply wait for Trump to tire of diplomacy and recall US troops home without completing the negotiations. There’s precedent for this: Despite ISIS’s continued presence in Syria, in December Trump shockingly ordered the return of America’s 2,000 troops stationed there. (However, that drawdown has not yet started in earnest.)  What’s more, it’s highly likely the Taliban will renege on any commitment it makes to the Afghan government if US forces aren’t around to back Kabul. Put together, Roggio said, “the US is debasing itself to the Taliban to get a peace deal that won’t result in peace.”  He’s not alone in that thinking. Vanda Felbab-Brown, an insurgency expert at the Brookings Institution think tank, told me there’s a “high likelihood we’re seeing a repeat of the Vietnam War negotiations.” In that instance, the US left the fight in 1973 after striking a deal with the North Vietnamese in hopes they would negotiate with their enemy, the South Vietnamese, and end the war. That didn’t happen. Instead, the North took over most of the nation, in violation of the US-brokered peace agreement.  Felbab-Brown noted a big difference between that moment and this one, though: The Taliban doesn’t have enough military might and power to control the entire country. But it can definitely control parts of Afghanistan’s more rural communities and engage in fighting multiple areas. Surely the Taliban would try to take control of Kabul, at some point, and that battle “would be a bloodbath,” she said.  Ultimately, few if any experts fully trust the Taliban to keep its word — leading some to wonder why we’re negotiating at all.  “Talking to the Taliban is a waste of time,” a retired Army three-star general who served in Afghanistan and has previously said he believes the US already lost the war there, told me. “Anything we offer remains negotiable. Once we’re gone, they intend to take over Afghanistan.”"

story1: "At the stroke of midnight Saturday, the partial government shutdown entered its 22nd day and became the longest in U.S. history.  The showdown between President Trump and Democrats, which began Dec. 22 over funding for Trump’s proposed border wall, has led to employee furloughs and some having to work without pay.  As some 800,000 federal workers received blank pay statements Friday, Congress voted to guarantee them back pay whenever the shutdown is resolved -- and then lawmakers adjourned for the weekend.  SHUTDOWN FALLOUT INTENSIFIES AS FEDERAL WORKERS MISS FIRST PAYCHECKS  The missing paychecks have put pressure on lawmakers and Trump to end the impasse. Some workers posted photos of empty pay stubs on Twitter and vented their frustration.  “I saw the zeros in my pay stub today, and it’s a combination of reality setting in and just sadness,” air traffic controller Josh Maria told the Associated Press.  Trump has floated the possibility of declaring a national emergency to bypass Congress to fund the wall but has walked back his stance in recent days. The White House has also explored diverting money for border wall construction from other accounts, including some of the $13.9 billion allocated to the Army Corps of Engineers.  REP. BIGGS: TRUMP SHOULD STAND FIRM TO FIGHT FOR THE BORDER WALL  "What we're not looking to do right now is national emergency," Trump said. He insisted that he had the authority to do that, adding that he's "not going to do it so fast" because he'd still prefer to work a deal with Congress.  That has led to an outcry from officials in Puerto Rico and some states recovering from natural disasters.  “It’s going to p--- off a lot of members,” Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, told the Wall Street Journal.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Some Republicans are pushing for Trump to declare a national emergency.  “Mr. President, Declare a national emergency NOW,” U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said on Twitter on Friday. “Build a wall NOW.”  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Trump of using the shutdown to divert attention from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.  BILA: 'REALLY PATHETIC' FOR SOME DEMOCRATS TO MAKE BORDER WALL FUNDING DEBATE ABOUT RACE  "This isn't a wall between Mexico and the United States. This is a wall between his failures of his administration," Pelosi told reporters. "This is a big diversion, and he's a master of diversion."  The Associated Press contributed to this report."

(Photo by SAUL LOEB / AFP) (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)  Raskin: I'm not losing my son in 2020 and my country in 2021  (CNN) —  President Donald Trump often boasts he’s presiding over a record breaking presidency.  Now he’s got another historic notch on his belt, the longest-ever government shutdown — an impasse that marks a new low for Washington dysfunction.  The dispute triggered by Trump’s demands for billions of dollars to finally make good on an unfulfilled campaign promise — to build a border wall — began so long ago that Republicans had a monopoly on Washington power. The Democratic takeover of the House has deepened the disconnect, and with neither side willing to fold, nearly 22 days in, there is still no end in sight.  Since Trump crowed he would be “proud” to shutter the government over the wall, he gets to shoulder much of the blame for a crisis that is the inevitable result when the nation’s political polarization is institutionalized in Washington.  The last three weeks have exposed the lack of empathy of a billionaire President who shrugs off the struggles of federal workers who work paycheck to paycheck. Trump is clearly more concerned about a pet political project than his constitutional role of providing governance to all Americans.  But he is not alone in his dereliction of duty. The Republican-led Senate is doing nothing to offer its President a face saving way out. And while House Democrats are going through the motions of passing bills to reopen government, they don’t seem to be doing much else to break the logjam. Before Trump was President, party leaders had seemed at least open to funding a barrier on the border as part of wider immigration legislation.  Trump urged party leaders Friday to return to Washington and vote for a wall, a barrier or whatever they want to call it – even “peaches.”  “This is where I ask the Democrats to come back to Washington and to vote for money for the wall, the barrier, whatever you want to call it, it’s OK with me,” the President said during a White House roundtable on immigration.  “They can name it whatever. They can name it ‘peaches.’ I don’t care what they name it. But we need money for that barrier,” he added.  The stalemate represents a crucial first fight between Trump and his Democratic enemies in Washington’s new era of divided government.  But every battle has victims. And right now it’s 800,000 government workers who feel insulted, forgotten and anxious about rent, mortgage, car payment and medical bills piling up.  While they fret, nothing is happening in Washington this weekend. In fact, members of Congress, who are getting paid, are off until Monday.  They might notice as they fly home that the nation’s transportation system is under strain. Many of those TSA agents who keep travelers safe are working without pay. An airport in Tampa is opening a food bank for employees. And some food inspections are on hold with government shut down.  “I would beg both Houses of Congress, I would beg the American people to please look around and understand that federal workers, we have a face — we have families,” Jacqueline Maloney, a federal worker whose paycheck didn’t arrive on Friday, told CNN’s Brooke Baldwin in an emotional interview.  “We might be a neighbor, your best friend, your best friend’s mom, your aunt, your cousin. We are everywhere.”  Government shutdowns usually end when the political leaders caught in the standoff calculate that the political damage sustained by standing firm begins to outweigh the embarrassment of a climbdown.  With tales of anger and deprivation of government workers stuck in a terrible situation beyond their control now dominating news coverage, that point may be coming closer.  Neither side however is showing any sign of cracking yet.  It’s on Trump  But for Trump, there would have been no shutdown. The President, apparently fearing a backlash in conservative media, refused to keep the government open before Christmas unless he got wall funding.  In the last week, Trump has tried a variety of political stunts to try to shift the blame. He gave an Oval Office address. He stormed out of talks with Democratic leaders. He flew Air Force One to the border to paint an inaccurate picture of hordes of criminals and killers pouring into the country.  “The only way you will stop it is with a very powerful wall or steel barrier,” Trump said at the White House on Friday.  Now, as he seeks taxpayer cash to build a wall that he promised Mexico would pay for, the President is offering the fact-bending claims that America’s neighbor has already settled up – in a yet to be ratified new trade deal.  By any conventional measure, Trump is guilty of putting his own political ego above the interests of the Americans he leads. For all the power of his campaign trail rhetoric among supporters, he’s not shifted the political needle at all. He seems oblivious that in divided government, a President can’t just demand what he wants.  Trump’s supporters argue that there is a genuine crisis on the border and brand as “fake news” any argument that a wall along the frontier with Mexico may not be the best way to tackle drug trafficking and ballooning asylum claims.  In fact, the wall has become such an emotional center of Trump’s relationship with his political base — and such a symbol of antipathy towards the President for those who oppose him — that it’s become an insoluble issue.  And government workers are paying the price.  “The bottom line is there is no excuse for the political stunt just because the President had made a commitment when he ran for office and afterwards,” said Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, in a CNN interview.  “He cannot get it done and deliver for his constituency. He should just stand up and say I tried and let’s get on with the next thing,” said Bloomberg, a possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. “There’s no one issue or one constituency. The President has not been elected to be the representative of a party, or of a small group, he’s supposed to be representative of a whole country.”  So far, Trump has held off on his threat to declare a national emergency and reprogram Pentagon funds — possibly from disaster relief projects in Puerto Rico and Texas — to finance his wall.  Such a step might allow him to declare a victory that most people will believe to be hollow. He might be able to sell his supporters on a battle in the courts after an almost certain legal challenge and reap political capital.  But it would also represent a fundamental flouting of constitutional governance, since a future president, thwarted by Congress fulfilling its core task of deciding how taxpayer money is spent, could choose to go ahead with a favorite political project regardless.  Hypocrisy  The failure of Congress to unpick the deadlock has disgusted some of its most venerable members.  “How can we resolve this? We owe it to the American people. This is like a circus,” Republican Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama said earlier in the week.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who once boasted that “I’m the guy that gets us out of shutdowns,” has been a ghostly presence.  McConnell has refused to act on Democratic House bills to open various government agencies, since Trump will not agree to sign them.  For now, McConnell has no desire to open cracks in the Republican coalition by breaking with a President who has leveraged his devoted base to punish any dissidents in his party.  There could come a time, however, when clear discomfort among some GOP members, like Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, Alaska’s Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Maine’s Sen. Susan Collins, begins to make life uncomfortable for McConnell.  The bitterness of shutdown politics has also revealed a seam of hypocrisy that festers on both sides of the aisle in this fractured political age.  In 2016, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham signed on to an amicus brief in a Supreme Court case challenging President Barack Obama’s use of executive power to shield recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program from deportation.  The document complained that Obama’s move was an attempt to supplant Congress’ power and a threat to the constitutional principle of separation of powers. Those norms seem less important to the South Carolinian now Trump is in the White House.  “Mr. President, Declare a national emergency NOW. Build a wall NOW,” Graham tweeted on Friday after meeting Trump.  Part of Graham’s frustration stems from his belief that Democrats are hypocrites for refusing to contemplate immigration enforcement policies that they have favored in the past.  Early last year, Democrats and the White House appeared close to a deal that would have given Trump $25 billion in border security in return for a path to citizenship for DACA recipients — undocumented migrants brought to the US illegally as children.  Trump eventually pulled out of the deal.  The idea of border fencing, or a wall in some areas, has not been so radioactive for Democrats in the past.  In 2006, Democrats including now-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and then-Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama voted to authorize a secure fence along about 700 miles of the US-Mexico border.  The project was far from the concrete or steel wall envisioned by Trump.  But given the symbolic potency of the idea of a wall, it’s not clear Democrats — who do not want their first act in the majority in the House to be a concession to Trump, would contemplate any such plan today.  “A wall is an immorality,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said this week.  CNN’s Liz Stark contributed to this report."

story1: "President Donald Trump stood firm during a sometimes testy interview with CBS' Lesley Stahl, and defended his policies along with his relationships with North Korea's Kim Jong Un and Russia's Vladimir Putin during an interview with CBS' "60 Minutes" that aired Sunday night.  The nearly 30-minute interview was recorded on Thursday.  What did Trump say about Kim?  Trump told Stahl that when he took office, the U.S. was facing the threat of going to war with North Korea.  "The day before I came in, we were goin' to war with North Korea. I sat with President Obama," Trump said. "[A]nd we were gonna, I think it was going to end up in war.  "We were going to war with North Korea. Now, you don't hear that. You don't hear any talk of it. And he doesn't wanna go to war, and we don't wanna go to war, and he understands denuclearization and he's agreed to it. And you see that he's agreed to it. No missiles," he added.  Trump said he trusts Kim, but added that it didn't mean he could be proven wrong.  "Well, first of all, if I didn't trust him, I wouldn't say that to you," Trump told Stahl when asked why he trusts the North Korean leader. "Wouldn't I be foolish to tell you right here, on '60 Minutes'?"  The president admitted that there's no proof that North Korea has stopped building missiles, as it has promised, but the Korean Peninsula is safer now that he has a relationship with the communist leader.  "In the meantime, they haven't tested a missile. They haven't tested a rocket. They definitely haven't done a nuclear test because you know about them real fast. It sort of moves the earth," he said. "And we have a relationship now."  Kim has asked for the U.S. to ease sanctions on his country, but the Trump administration has refused.  "No, I'm not doing it," Trump told Stahl. "This isn't the Obama administration. I haven't eased the sanctions.  "We have a good relationship. It's very important."  At a recent rally, Trump told supporters that he loves Kim. Stahl questioned him about the statements.  "I get along with him okay," Trump explained to Stahl when asked why he loves Kim. "That's just a figure of speech.  "Look. Let it be whatever it is. I get along with him really well. I have a good energy with him. I have a good chemistry with him. Look at the horrible threats that were made," he added. "No more threats. No more threats."  What did he say about Putin?  The president pushed back when Stahl asked him why he never has harsh words to say about Russian president Putin.  "I think I'm very tough with him personally," he told Stahl. "I had a meeting with him. The two of us. It was a very tough meeting and it was a very good meeting."  He went on to say that he has helped Ukraine fight back against the Russian invasion.  "I'm the one that gave Ukraine offensive weapons and tank killers. Obama didn't. You know what he sent? He sent pillows and blankets. I'm the one — and he's the one that gave away a part of Ukraine where Russia now has this," Trump continued before being cut off by Stahl.  And Trump said he believes Putin was likely involved in recent assassinations and poisonings.  "But I rely on them. It's not in our country," he said.  "Of course, they shouldn't do it," Trump added, when Stahl pointed out Russia's actions were a terrible thing.  What else?  Trump said he knows Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election, adding that he believes China also meddled."
story2: "NASA embraces the widely cited statistic that “97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree” that warming trends are the result of human activity, while also listing 200 worldwide scientific organizations that hold to the same findings.  The other approximately 3 percent that reject anthropogenic warming? Turns out scientists went back to try to recreate the findings of those studies — and in each one found major methodological flaws.  Costs and consequences  What Mr. Trump said  “I will say this. I don’t want to give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don’t want to lose millions and millions of jobs. I don’t want to be put at a disadvantage.”  The facts  Not doing anything could cost trillions of dollars.  Here the president is referring in large part to the Paris Agreement, the voluntary pact among nearly 200 nations to curb rising greenhouse gas emissions, from which the Trump administration has vowed to withdraw. In announcing that the United States would abandon the Paris deal, Mr. Trump argued that it would have cost 2.7 million American jobs by 2025 and untold economic revenue.  The numbers came from think tanks opposed to the Paris Agreement. And while economics is less precise than science, here is another for balance: Stanford University researchers this year found that meeting the goals of the Paris deal would save the world tens of trillions of dollars in avoided climate damages, far outweighing most estimated costs.  Science and politics  What Mr. Trump said  “Look, scientists also have a political agenda.”  Asked about scientists who say hurricanes and other extreme weather events are worsening, Mr. Trump replied, “You’d have to show me the scientists because they have a very big political agenda.”  The facts  Scientists dispute that.  No doubt climate change has become politicized. And climate skeptics Sunday night cheered Mr. Trump’s remark. But scientists took umbrage at the notion that their research has an agenda. Here are three in their own words:  Katharine Hayhoe , climate scientist, Texas Tech University: “A thermometer isn’t Democrat or Republican. It doesn’t give us a different answer depending on how we vote .”  Andrew Dessler , climate scientist, Texas A&M University: “At its heart, this is just a wacky conspiracy theory,” he wrote. “It’s important to realize that there’s never been a conspiracy by a huge field of science. And this would have to be an extremely massive conspiracy, considering the thousands of scientists working on this. On the other hand, there have been many examples (cigarettes, anyone?) where political advocates have tried to cast doubt on science that is extremely solid. That’s what’s going on here.”"

story1: "The FBI has reached out to a second woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault -- a day after President Trump ordered the bureau to conduct a new background investigation.  An attorney for Deborah Ramirez, who claims that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a Yale college party in the 1980s, said that the FBI had reached out to her.  "We can confirm the FBI has reached out to interview Ms. Ramirez and she has agreed to cooperate with their investigation," attorney John Clune said in a statement. "Out of respect for the integrity of the process, we will have no further comment at this time."  The development was first reported by The Washington Post.  Before heading to West Virginia on Saturday for a political rally, President Trump expressed confidence in Kavanaugh.  "I would expect it's going to turn out very well for the judge," he said. "There's never been anybody that's been looked at like Judge Kavanaugh."  Trump said he had no backup plan concerning his nomination, and didn't need one.  The president also voiced confidence in the investigative process. "The FBI I believe is doing a really great job," he said. They have been all over already. They have free rein. They're going to do whatever they have to do, whatever it is they do. They'll be doing things that we've never even thought of, and hopefully at the conclusion everything will be fine."  In the added inquiry, which he expects to take less than a week, Trump said there might be "a blessing in disguise," exposing Democrats' machinations over the past several days.  The FBI background check comes after Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., joined Democrats on Friday in calling for the investigation into sexual assault allegations made against Kavanaugh.  Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied all accusations against him.  FLAKE DEFENDS CALL FOR KAVANAUGH DELAY: 'WE'RE COMING APART AT THE SEAMS'  On Thursday Kavanaugh testified to a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing after Christine Blasey Ford testified that he had assaulted her at a high school party in 1982. In a blistering response, he called the circumstances surrounding his nomination a "circus."  On Friday, the committee voted to recommend Kavanaugh to the Senate for confirmation to the high court post, but Flake requested the “limited” weeklong background check. With Republicans holding a very slim majority in the Senate, Trump ordered the investigation despite GOP leaders having previously argued there was no need for further investigation.  The inquiry is expected to wrap by Friday.  In a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Saturday, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, requested that the bureau notify the White House Counsel's Office immediately if any witnesses attempt to in any way delay the investigation or decline to cooperate.  One key reason for his concern, wrote Hatch, a member and former chairman of the Senate Judicary Committee, "comes from testimony during the hearing this past Thursday. According to Dr. Ford, she would have preferred to have been interviewed in California, away from the spectacle of a public hearing. But her lawyers apparently refused to convey to their client numerous offers by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley to conduct a public or private interview in a location of her choosing. The lawyers’ refusal led directly to a public hearing, against Dr. Ford’s express wishes. This is deeply troubling."    Republicans have accused Democrats of trying to delay the vote until after the midterms, when Democrats are hoping to have retaken control of the Senate. Democrats, in turn, have assailed what they say has been a rush toward confirmation regardless of the allegations against the judge.  On Friday Flake defended his decision to press for the further inquiry, saying he wanted to protect the credibility of America’s institutions.  “Two institutions, really,” he told the Atlantic. “One, the Supreme Court is the lone institution where most Americans still have some faith. And then the U.S. Senate as an institution — we’re coming apart at the seams. There’s no currency, no market for reaching across the aisle. It just makes it so difficult.”  However, he also said that the delay could eventually help both Republicans, and Kavanaugh himself.  “Obviously. I’ve felt that this delay is as much to help him as us. My hope is that some Democrats will say, “Hey, we may not change our vote, but this process was worthy of the institution, and we feel satisfied.”  "That means something,” he said. “The country needs to hear that.”  A third woman has also leveled charges against Kavanaugh. As was the case with Ford and Ramirez, she said the events occurred decades ago.  In a sworn declaration, Julie Swetnick of Washington, D.C., said she witnessed him "consistently engage in excessive drinking and inappropriate contact of a sexual nature with women in the early 1980s" and that Kavanaugh was involved in "gang" rapes of girls at parties.  As with the other cases, the judge has maintained his innocence.  Fox News' Mike Emanuel and Jeffrey Rubin contributed to this report."
story2: "(CNN) —  The FBI has reached out to Deborah Ramirez, who has accused Brett Kavanaugh of inappropriate sexual behavior when they were in college, in its background investigation of the Supreme Court nominee, her lawyer has confirmed to CNN.  “We can confirm the FBI has reached out to interview Ms. Ramirez and she has agreed to cooperate with their investigation,” Ramirez’s attorney, John Clune, said in a statement. “Out of respect for the integrity of the process, we will have no further comment at this time.”  The Washington Post first reported that the FBI has contacted Ramirez.  Ramirez came forward with her allegation in The New Yorker, telling the publication that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at dormitory party while the two were undergraduate students at Yale.  The FBI is also investigating the allegation of Christine Blasey Ford that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were high schoolers in the Washington, DC, suburbs.  Kavanaugh has vehemently denied both allegations.  On Friday, President Donald Trump directed the FBI to re-open its background investigation of his nominee after Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona called for a one-week delay to the Senate floor vote on the nomination so that the agency could investigate Ford’s allegations.  A senior GOP leadership aide told CNN that the first key procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh’s nomination would be no later than Friday and could happen sooner if the FBI wraps up its investigation before then.

story1: "The Obama administration granted a license letting Iran access the United States financial system despite officials’ pledges that they would prohibit it, according to a draft report from the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.  “On Feb. 24, 2016, the Treasury Department issued a specific license to Bank Muscat to authorize the conversion of Iran’s rials to euros through ‘any United States depository institution …,’” the draft report said. “Even after the specific license was issued, U.S. government officials maintained in congressional testimony that Iran would not be granted access to the U.S. financial system.”  “The Obama administration during the negotiation of the Iran deal misled the American people,” said Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), subcommittee chairman. “I think they did so because they were desperate to get a deal.”  When the nations involved in the Iran nuclear agreement implemented the deal, Iran had $5.7 billion in assets at Bank Muscat in Muscat, Oman, maintained as Omani rials, according to the subcommittee. Iran wanted to access that money, and using the U.S. financial system to convert it “was the most efficient means, even though U.S. sanctions prohibited it,” according to the report.  Government officials tried to convince two U.S. banks to execute the conversion. They both declined, citing the complexity and the unwanted appearance involved in processing an Iranian transaction, according to the report.  Without a compliant American bank, a senior State Department official said he believed Bank Muscat and Iran eventually used European banks to convert the funds, said the committee.  Portman said his subcommittee began investigating the transaction last summer. In an interview with an unnamed senior State Department official, the panel said, the official acknowledged that the administration “’exceeded our JCPOA commitments’ because there was nothing in the JCPOA that required the issuance of the specific license,” according to the report. (JCPOA is the acronym for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran.)  A former administration official disputes the subcommittee's conclusion, saying the Treasury Department never authorized Iran to access U.S. investments or markets, conduct commercial transactions in U.S. dollars or open correspondent accounts at U.S. banks.  “This specific license cannot be described as ‘granting access to the U.S. financial system,’” the former official said. “This specific license was in fulfillment of JCPOA commitments to give Iran access to pools of its money held overseas. It was aimed solely to allow the movement of Iran’s own funds stranded at an Omani bank into euros at a European bank, where Iran could then make use of them.”"
story2: "President Barack Obama’s administration reportedly misled Congress — and the American people — about a crucial element of the Iran nuclear deal.  A GOP-led investigation by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations revealed on Wednesday that Obama’s Treasury Department secretly worked on a license to allow Iran access to the American financial system.  A license, according to the Treasury Department, is “an authorization from [Treasury] to engage in a transaction that otherwise would be prohibited.”  It’s a big claim. Recall that the Iran deal had the US lift certain sanctions on Tehran in exchange for Iranians curbing their nuclear program. But the US didn’t remove every penalty after signing the agreement in 2015 — meaning that Iran’s access to the US financial system was still limited.  But according to the new report, the US Treasury Department issued a license to Oman’s Bank of Muscat on February 24, 2016. That license would have let Iran change $5.7 billion worth of Omani rials it held at the bank into euros — after first changing them into US dollars.  Iran could not change money into dollars without the license, since this would have violated sanctions that were still in place.  However, two US banks refused to help with the conversion of Iranian-owned Omani rials into dollars — even after Obama officials approached them — reportedly citing a severe hit to their reputations. After all, they knew they would be perceived as circumventing the Iran nuclear deal and aiding Tehran.  The Associated Press was the first to report on the Senate subcommittee’s findings.  Sean Kane, a former sanctions official in Obama’s Treasury Department and now a lawyer at Dechert LLP, told me that Treasury “is not and was not in the practice of allowing Iran even indirect access to the US financial system.”  He continued, “What is being reported appears to be a limited authorization that would have allowed a one-time conversion of specific Iranian reserves held abroad, not something that allowed them to continue accessing the US financial system on a going-forward basis.” Kane also noted that Treasury can issue licenses based on America’s changing foreign policy needs.  That’s not how some critics see it. “The Obama effort to boost Iran’s economy not only ran counter to American interests, it skirted the law,” Jonathan Schanzer, an Iran expert at the conservative Foundation for the Defense of Democracies think tank, tweeted on Wednesday.  Did the Obama administration lie about helping Iran?  What makes this revelation worse, Republican lawmakers say, is that the Obama administration may have at best misled — and at worst, deliberately lied — about granting Iran limited access to the US financial system.  “The Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran,” Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH), the subcommittee’s chair, said in a statement.  Here’s why Portman and others make that claim: In Wednesday’s report, they note statements from top Obama officials saying that this type of action wasn’t a possibility. Iran “will continue to be denied access to the [US’s] financial and commercial market,” then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July 2015.  And Adam Szubin, a top Treasury official under Obama, said this to the Senate Banking Committee later that month: “Iranian banks will not be able to clear US dollars through New York, hold correspondent account relationships with US financial institutions, or enter into financing arrangements with US banks.”  It’s still unclear if there was a coordinated effort to keep this specific license hidden from Congress and the American people. But clearly, the Obama administration covertly did more to help Iran than previously known."

story1: "An urgent manhunt is underway Sunday for a shooter who gunned down at least four people and injured several others at a Tennessee Waffle House before a "hero" patron wrestled the weapon away, police said.  Authorities surrounded an apartment complex where they believe alleged gunman Travis Reinking, 29, may be hiding after he shot at patrons at a Waffle House in Antioch, located about 16 miles southeast of downtown Nashville. They reportedly later cleared the area after it appeared Reinking was not there.  "A man believed to be Travis Reinking was last seen in a wood line near Discovery at Mountain View Apts. on Mountain Springs Dr. near the Waffle House. The man was seen wearing black pants and no shirt," Nashville police tweeted just after 8 a.m. Sunday, the last time he was spotted.  Don Aaron, spokesman of the Metro Nashville Police Department, initially told WTVF: "If you see a nude guy walking around this morning call the police department."  Reinking, who was last spotted with black pants and no shirt on after fleeing the scene naked, pulled up to the restaurant in his pickup truck about 3:25 a.m. and fatally shot two people outside with an assault-type rifle, police said. The alleged shooter then gunned down patrons dining inside, killing at least one person. Another individual died at the hospital.  No further details about the victims were released.  Chuck Cordero, who is a regular customer and friends with the employees at the Waffle House, told WTVF he was waiting outside the restaurant when he heard gunshots. Cordero said the restaurant was busy and he was waiting for the booth he usually sits in to clear out.  "I showed up tonight and they were a little busy so I stayed in my car. As I got out, this lunatic in a pickup pulled up," Cordero said. "[The gunman] shot a customer going in the door, shot my friend on sidewalk, shot through windows and then went in shooting. He pulled up, got right out; he was prepared to do what he did."  A 29-year-old patron, identified as James Shaw Jr., was attempting to flee the gunfire when he saw the shooter struggling with the rifle at one point. Shaw told the Tennessean he saw an opportunity and charged at the shooter, wrestled the weapon away and tossed it over the restaurant’s counter.  "He is the hero here and no doubt he saved many lives by wrestling the gun away," Aaron said.  Cordero said he also saw a man who "jumped in" as the gunman was reloading the rifle.  "There's a gentleman who was in there that when the guy stopped to reload his gun he jumped him," Cordero recalled. "Had that guy reloaded, there was plenty of people in that restaurant that would not have made it home this morning."  Shaw suffered an elbow injury and other abrasions when he was grazed by a bullet. He was treated for his injuries and released from the hospital.  At least two of the four injured suffered gunshot wounds. One person is said to be in critical condition and another is in critical but stable condition, FOX17 reported. Aaron said some people at the restaurant had "visible cuts" on their faces due to flying glass when shots were fired.  "The people inside the restaurant were very very shaken. They were in tears," Aaron said. "Some of the folks who didn’t have to be transported [to the hospital] had glass wounds on their faces.”  Police initially described the gunman as a man with short hair who was last seen walking on Murfreesboro Pike after the shooting. They added that Reinking allegedly shed his green coat after firing his gun and is nude. Reinking reportedly then ran to a nearby apartment complex, where he lives, and put pants, Aaron said. Several residents in the area reported seeing a naked man in the area.  Authorities identified Reinking as the suspect after finding the vehicle allegedly used by the gunman was registered in that name. Aaron said officials are still gathering information on Reinking, but found that the alleged gunman’s license “goes back to Illinois.” Nashville police checked with authorities in Illinois who said Reinking has a history with firearms in that state.  The motive of the deadly shooting or why Reinking was in Nashville is still unclear.  UTAH PARENTS KILL THEIR 2 CHILDREN BEFORE THEMSELVES AFTER BELIEVING MOM HAD TERMINAL DISEASE  Pat Warner, Waffle House's director of PR and external affairs, said in a statement to Fox News that members of management are at the Nashville location assisting with the incident. He deferred all other questions to the Metro Nashville Police Department.  "We are deeply saddened by this tragic incident. Right now, our first thoughts are with the victims and their families, and we will be there for them in this most difficult time. We are still gathering the details, and so we do not have much information to share," the statement read.  "This is a very sad day for the Waffle House family, and we ask for everyone to keep the victims and their families in their thoughts and prayers," Warner added.  Nashville Mayor David Briley tweeted: "It’s a tragic day for our city anytime people lose their lives at the hands of a gunman. My heart goes out to the families & friends of every person who was killed or wounded in this morning’s shooting. I know all of their lives will be forever changed by this devastating crime."  Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam said he and his wife, Crissy, "are deeply saddened by the tragic incident in Antioch early this morning, and we mourn the lives taken in this senseless act of violence."  The Associated Press contributed to this report."
story2: "The suspected gunman who killed four people and wounded four others at a Tennessee Waffle House early Sunday morning has been apprehended, police said on Monday. The incident took place in Antioch, in the Nashville metropolitan.  The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said a nude man began shooting at the restaurant at about 3:25 am. A patron, later identified as 29-year-old James Shaw Jr., wrestled the gun away from him, and he fled on foot.  The police identified Travis Reinking, 29, as as a suspect in the shooting and said murder warrants were drafted against him. Police continued their search for him overnight until arresting him on Monday.  What we know  A gunman opened fire at a Waffle House restaurant in Antioch, Tennessee, at 3:25 am Sunday. Six people were shot, including four who died and two others were injured.  The victims were identified as Taurean Sanderlin, 29, Joe Perez, 20, DeEbony Groves, 21, and Akilah DaSilva, 23.  The Metropolitan National Police Department tweeted that a patron “wrestled away the gunman’s rifle” and that he was nude and fled on foot. “The man who wrestled the gun away is a hero,” Metro Nashville police spokesperson Don Aaron told CNN.  The patron was later identified as 29-year-old James Shaw Jr., who spoke with the Tennessean. “I don’t really know, when everyone said that, it feels selfish,” he said when asked about the descriptions of him as a hero. “I was just trying to get myself out. I saw the opportunity and pretty much took it.” He said he was grazed by a bullet, treated for a minor gunshot wound, and released from the hospital Sunday morning.  Shaw described the incident and his decision to wrestle the gun away from the gunman at a press conference on Sunday. “He was going to have to work to — work to kill me,” he said.

story1: "President Trump signed a directive Friday ordering the government to end the so-called “catch-and-release” policy at the border, moving to combat what the administration says is a growing “crisis” of illegal immigration.  He called for illegal immigrants nabbed at the border to be held in custody, to the fullest extent possible. He also ordered more asylum officers to head to detention centers so they can rule on cases faster, calculating that if they can clear the cases they can send undeserving migrants home without having to release them.  In a memo to his attorney general and secretaries of the State, Defense, Homeland and Health and Human Services departments, Mr. Trump also demanded regular updates on progress, and told them to submit requests for any new resources they need.  “The safety and security of the American people is the president’s highest priority, and he will keep his promise to protect our country and to ensure that our laws are respected,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.  Catch-and-release is the name Border Patrol agents and others involved in the immigration debate have given to the practice of arresting illegal immigrants, processing them and then having to set them free in the U.S., with the order that they return for a deportation hearing some time in the future.  They disappear into the shadows and most never bother to show for their hearings, which can be years later.  The Bush administration had tried to end catch-and-release by speeding up deportations of Mexicans. But a shift in migration patterns, with a surge in people from Central America — particularly children and families — has caused the issue to raise its head again.  U.S. law, court cases and Obama administration decisions have made it much tougher to deport those people, with a host of legal protections built up around them pushing for them to be released from custody if their cases can’t be cleared quickly.  Earlier Friday Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered prosecutors along the southwest border to bring criminal misdemeanor charges against people who jump the border.  Mr. Trump’s new memo calls on Mr. Sessions and the other departments to crack down on abuse of the asylum system, after illegal immigrants have learned how to game the system by using “magic words” indicating they fear being sent back home.  Before 2013, only about 1 percent of migrants showing up on the border claimed asylum. Now the number is higher than 10 percent, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said this week.  “Smugglers themselves are gaming the system, pure and simple. They take advantage of the loopholes in our laws. They know that we cannot prosecute as we need to to stop their behavior,” she said.

story2: "President Trump issued a memorandum on Friday directing his administration to move quickly to bring an end to “catch and release,” the practice by which immigrants presenting themselves at the border without authorization are released from detention while waiting for their cases to be processed.  The directive does not, on its own, toughen immigration policy or take concrete steps to do so; it merely directs officials to report to the president about steps they are taking to “expeditiously end ‘catch and release’ practices.” But it is a symbolic move by Mr. Trump to use his executive action to solve a problem that he has bitterly complained Congress will not.  It also caps a week that began with the president offering tough talk on immigration and ended with his ordering the National Guard to patrol the southwestern border, a move formalized on Friday night when Defense Secretary Jim Mattis signed orders to deploy up to 4,000 troops.  “The safety and security of the American people is the president’s highest priority, and he will keep his promise to protect our country and to ensure that our laws are respected,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement announcing the memorandum."

story1: "WASHINGTON (AP) — Buoyed by the sudden likelihood of a budget pact, lawmakers are on track avoid a repeat of last month’s government shutdown — though President Donald Trump unexpectedly raised the possibility of closing things down again if he can’t have his way on immigration.  “I’d love to see a shutdown if we can’t get this stuff taken care of,” Trump declared Tuesday, repeating the sentiment for emphasis.  Trump’s comments were strikingly disconnected from the progress on Capitol Hill, where the House passed a short-term spending measure Tuesday night and Senate leaders were closing in on a larger, long-term pact after of a Thursday night deadline. The broader agreement would award whopping spending increases to both the Pentagon and domestic federal programs, as well as approve overdue disaster relief money and, perhaps, crucial legislation to increase the government’s borrowing limit and avoid a possible default.  Democratic leaders have dropped their strategy of using the funding fight to extract concessions on immigration, specifically on seeking extended protections for the “Dreamer” immigrants who have lived in the country illegally since they were children. Instead, the Democrats prepared to cut a deal that would reap tens of billions of dollars for other priorities — including combatting opioids — while taking their chances on solving the immigration impasse later.  Tuesday night’s 245-182 House vote, mostly along party lines, set the machinery in motion. The six-week stopgap spending bill contains increases for the military that long have been demanded by Trump and his GOP allies. But the measure appears increasingly likely to be rewritten by the Senate to include legislation implementing the brewing broader budget pact.  House Democrats canceled a scheduled three-day retreat on Maryland’s Eastern Shore to develop a strategy for the midterm elections. A spokeswoman blamed the cancellation on “the pressing issues Congress will likely vote on over the next three days.”  The budget negotiations, conducted chiefly by the Senate’s top leaders, Republican Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Chuck Schumer of New York, have intensified in recent days — and the looming government shutdown at midnight Thursday added urgency to the talks. In addition to the military and domestic spending, the deal taking shape would approve overdue disaster relief money and, perhaps, crucial legislation to increase the government’s borrowing limit and avoid possible default.  Both McConnell and Schumer reported progress Tuesday morning.  “I think we’re on the way to getting an agreement and getting it very soon,” said McConnell.  Prospects for dealing with immigration, however, were as fuzzy as ever. The Senate is slated next week to begin a debate to address the dilemma of immigrants left vulnerable by the looming expiration of former President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.  Weeks of bargaining have left the two parties divided over how to extend protections for such Dreamer immigrants and a court ruling has blunted a March 5 deadline.  McConnell said Tuesday that while he hopes “we will end up having something,” he was unsure if any proposed measure would get the 60 votes needed for approval.  On Tuesday, White House chief of staff John Kelly threw fuel on the dispute as he defended Trump’s proposed solution. The retired general noted the White House proposal would expand protection for some 1.8 million immigrants. That group includes both the 690,000 currently shielded and also “the people that some would say were too afraid to sign up, others would say were too lazy to get off their asses, but they didn’t sign up,” he said.  No. 2 Senate Democratic leader Dick Durbin of Illinois, his party’s chief immigration negotiator, bristled at the comment.  “I’m sorry for that characterization. It doesn’t surprise me from Gen. Kelly,” he said.  The budget talks appeared to be going more smoothly.  GOP defense hawks were prevailing over the party’s depleted ranks of deficit hawks, championing major new spending on military programs. Democrats, meanwhile, leveraged their influence to increase spending for domestic priorities such as combating opioid misuse.  The result could be the return of trillion-dollar deficits for the first time since Obama’s first term.  The stopgap spending bill would keep the government open through March 23 to allow time to write and pass detailed follow-up “omnibus” legislation to fund the government through the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year.  The prospective longer-term budget agreement would give both the Pentagon and domestic agencies relief from a budget freeze that lawmakers say threatens military readiness and training as well as domestic priorities such as combating opioid abuse and repairing the government’s troubled health care system for veterans.  The temporary funding measure would also reauthorize funding for community health centers, which enjoy widespread bipartisan support.  Aides in both parties said the budget measure may also contain a provision to raise the government’s $20.5 trillion borrowing limit. Legislation to increase the debt ceiling is always a headache, especially for House GOP leaders whose rank and file have in the past used the votes to register an objection to deficit spending.  Another likely addition is more than $80 billion in long-overdue hurricane relief for Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, a top priority of lawmakers in both parties.  Under Congress’ arcane ways, a broad-brush agreement to increase legally binding spending “caps” — which would otherwise keep the budgets for the military and domestic agencies essentially frozen — would be approved, then followed by a far more detailed catchall spending bill that would take weeks to negotiate.  It’s clear that Senate Democrats have no appetite for another government shutdown. Their unity splintered during last month’s three-day closure.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., had linked progress on the budget with action to address the immigration program, but other Democrats are beginning to agitate for delinking the two, lest the opportunity for a budget pact is lost. And having tried and failed to link progress on the budget to DACA during last month’s government shutdown battle, many Democrats aren’t spoiling for a repeat.  “It’s hard. If we can get a good deal that funds disaster relief, funds domestic priorities, funds the opioid crisis it would be a difficult call,” said Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash. “DACA’s important and it ought to get done. But what’s the path?”  Schumer said he and Pelosi are “working from the same page,” appearing to discount speculation that she might oppose the coming pact.  Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

story2: "The House bill, which passed 245 to 182, would fund most agencies through March 23 but is a nonstarter in the Senate because of Democratic opposition.  But the top Senate leaders of both parties told reporters earlier in the day that a breakthrough was at hand on a longer-term budget deal. Spending has vexed the Republican-controlled Congress for months, forcing lawmakers to rely on multiple short-term patches.  AD  AD  “We’re on the way to getting an agreement and on the way to getting an agreement very soon,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).  Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) echoed him, “I am very hopeful that we can come to an agreement, an agreement very soon.”  Despite the optimism, no agreement was finalized with less than three days until Thursday’s deadline. And even as congressional leaders were sounding an upbeat note, Trump was raising tensions by openly pondering a shutdown if Democrats did not agree to his immigration policies.  “I’d love to see a shutdown if we don’t get this stuff taken care of,” Trump said at a White House event focused on crime threats posed by some immigrants. “If we have to shut it down because the Democrats don’t want safety . . . let’s shut it down.”  If Congress doesn't reach agreement on crucial immigration issues and pass a spending bill, the costly consequence would be another government shutdown. (The Washington Post)  AD  AD  Trump’s remarks appeared unlikely to snuff out the negotiations, which mainly involved top congressional leaders and their aides — not the president or his White House deputies — and have largely steered clear of the explosive immigration issue.  White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday afternoon that Trump was not pushing for the inclusion of immigration policies in the budget accord, something that would upend the sensitive talks.  “I don’t think that we expect the budget deal to include specifics on the immigration reform,” she said. “But we want to get a deal on that.”  The agreement McConnell and Schumer are contemplating, with input from House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), would clear the way for a bipartisan accord that would break through the sharp divides that helped prompt a three-day government shutdown last month.  AD  AD  Under tentative numbers discussed by congressional aides who were not authorized to speak publicly about the negotiations, defense spending would get an $80 billion boost above the existing $549 billion in spending for 2018. Nondefense spending would rise by $63 billion from its current $516 billion. The 2019 budget would include similar increases.  “Democrats have made our position in these negotiations very clear,” Schumer said on the Senate floor Tuesday. “We support an increase in funding for our military and our middle class. The two are not mutually exclusive. We don’t want to do just one and leave the other behind.”  Among the other issues that could be addressed in the deal is an increase in the federal debt limit, which could be reached as soon as early March, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The aides said that an increase was being discussed in the negotiations but that no final decisions have been made.  AD  AD  “It’s a question of what the traffic will bear,” said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 3 Senate GOP leader, describing the likelihood of a debt-ceiling increase.  A disaster aid package aimed at the victims of recent hurricanes and wildfires is also part of the talks, potentially adding $80 billion or more to the deal’s overall price tag. That provision could help win support from lawmakers representing affected areas in California, Florida and Texas but further repel conservatives concerned about mounting federal spending.  Even the rumors of a coming deal were enough to send some hard-liners reeling.  “This is a bad, bad, bad, bad — you could say ‘bad’ a hundred times — deal,” said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus. “When you put it all together, a quarter-of-a-trillion-dollar increase in discretionary spending — not what we’re supposed to be doing.”  AD  AD  If the parties cannot reach an agreement in the next two days, it is unclear how a shutdown might be averted.  Multiple House Republicans said Tuesday that if the Senate takes their spending bill and substitutes its version with a significant boost for domestic programs, they could not vote for it. House Democrats, meanwhile, have showed only limited willingness to help pass temporary spending measures absent a broader agreement.  Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the Freedom Caucus chairman, said a broad deal encompassing a debt-limit increase and a huge disaster package would be “considered a lead balloon” among hard-line conservatives. “It’d get zero support” from the caucus, he said, aside from a member or two representing states affected by the disasters.  AD  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told members of the House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that Congress should “not let disagreements on domestic policy continue to hold our nation’s defense hostage.” He warned that a failure to pass long-term funding would imperil troop paychecks, inhibit the maintenance of planes and ships, stunt recruiting and otherwise harm military readiness.  AD  “To carry out the strategy you rightly directed we develop, we need you to pass a budget now,” he said.  The House bill would increase Pentagon funding to $584 billion and guarantee it through Sept. 30, while the rest of the government would continue to be funded at 2017 levels through March 23.  AD  The bill would also provide two years of funding for the federal community health-center program, which lapsed last year and is at risk of running out of spending authority, and it would extend several other programs.  The bill also would affect many other moving parts in the health-care system. It would postpone planned cuts in funding to hospitals that treat an especially large share of poor patients, eliminating reductions in “disproportionate share” payments for this year and 2019 and shifting the $6 billion in reductions to 2021 through 2023."

story1: "Senate Republican leaders released a new Obamacare repeal bill Thursday that keeps some of the 2010 law’s tax hikes but further erodes its coverage mandates, allowing insurers to offer slimmer plans that could entice young and healthy Americans to sign up but raise costs for older and sicker customers.  The revised bill, though, has already lost support from the right in Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and from the center in Sen. Susan M. Collins of Maine, leaving Republicans with no extra margin for error ahead of a floor showdown next week.  A number of other senators are withholding their support and waiting to see what budget analysts say about the bill, but a defection by any of them, combined with Mr. Paul and Ms. Collins, would sink the repeal effort.  Two Republicans offered an alternative plan Thursday that would send Obamacare money to states and let them decide how to spend it, suggesting yet another option that could complicate the debate.  President Trump is pushing for a bill, saying he will be “very angry” if the Senate can’t pull it off, and leaders now say their troops face a binary choice: They can either vote for repeal or violate their 7-year-old pledge to do so.  “This is our opportunity to really make a difference on health care. This is our chance to bring about changes we’ve been talking about since Obamacare was forced on the American people,” said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican.  His new bill attempts to patch some holes in his first version, which was supposed to be an improvement over a House Republican bill that Mr. Trump had reportedly chided as “mean.”  Hoping to win over conservatives, Mr. McConnell included a version of a plan by Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, to let insurers offer both Obamacare-compliant plans and skinnier plans that would be cheaper for consumers balking at soaring premiums under Obamacare.  The bill also would keep Obamacare’s 3.8 percent tax on investment income and a 0.9 percent payroll tax hike on high earners. It also maintains Obamacare’s limit on the amount of executive pay that insurance companies can deduct from their taxes.  Republican leaders used some of that money to add to the “stability fund” they have created, which is designed to help insurers avoid heavy losses and to keep premiums in check. Another $45 billion would be invested in opioid addiction treatment — a key priority for Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia.  Neither Mr. Portman nor Ms. Capito said how they would vote on the latest bill.  Ms. Collins, though, said the bill still siphons too much money away from Medicaid — costs she said would have to be picked up by states.  “It would hurt the most vulnerable citizens. It would have an adverse impact, particularly on our rural health care providers, our hospitals and our nursing homes, and it is not something that I can support,” she told reporters.  She said by refusing to craft the bill in an open committee process, they are making the same mistake that President Obama and congressional Democrats made seven years ago: jamming through a massive overhaul of health care without any support from the other party.  The biggest change in the bill is the adoption of Mr. Cruz’s plan to allow insurers to slim down their plans, freeing them from the long coverage list Obamacare required of every offering.  Republicans hope that would entice more young and healthy customers to maintain coverage. Insurance lobbyists condemned the idea, saying they need those customers to buy the more expensive plans on Obamacare’s exchanges in order to subsidize the costs for older, sicker customers.  Moderate Republicans are also skeptical, saying Americans with pre-existing medical conditions will have to pay more, though added stabilization money is designed to assuage their concerns.  Mr. Cruz says it’s better to subsidize insurers that take on people with pre-existing conditions with direct revenue than force healthy people to pay higher premiums.  Mr. Paul, however, said that would accelerate the type of entitlement spending that conservatives once pushed to eliminate. Ms. Collins said stability funding has been earmarked for several uses, so there might not be enough to go around.  Leaders placed the Cruz plan in brackets to signal that there is room to tweak the provision, though some Republicans want them to scrap it altogether.  “Allowing insurance companies to sell bare-bones, tax-credit-eligible, catastrophic plans would create a segmented insurance market and essentially return cancer patients, survivors and anyone with a serious illness to an underfunded high-risk pool where a patient’s out-of-pocket costs could be unaffordable and coverage potentially inadequate,” said Chris Hansen, president of the American Cancer Society’s lobbying arm.  Still, the Cruz measure is key to winning over other conservatives, including Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who said he was still vetting the language.  Democrats remain unanimously opposed.  “The meat of this bill is exactly the same as it was before, and in some ways, they’ve somehow managed to make it even worse,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat.  Some Republicans are floating an off-ramp from the current path.  Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina pitched an alternative to the bill that he plans to offer as an amendment next week. In essence, it would let the states decide what to do with their share of the more than $100 billion in federal funding that is doled out each year under Obamacare.  Mr. Graham, a Republican, worked on the measure with Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.  “Instead of having a one-size-fits-all solution from Washington, we should return dollars back to the states to address each individual state’s health care needs,” Mr. Graham said. “Just like no two patients are the same, no two states’ health care needs are the same.”  Sign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters  Copyright © 2021 The Washington Times, LLC.

story2: "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) released a new proposal to overhaul the Affordable Care Act on Thursday after spending three weeks reworking it to win over wavering lawmakers on the right and in the center.  But within hours, it was clear that Senate leaders still didn’t have the votes to fulfill their long-standing quest to replace former president Barack Obama’s 2010 health-care law.  The new draft would lift many of the ACA’s regulatory requirements, allowing insurers to offer bare-bones policies without coverage for services such as preventive or mental-health care. It would also direct billions of dollars to help lower- and middle-income Americans buy plans on the private market.  However, the draft leaves in place deep proposed cuts to Medicaid — and at least three Republicans quickly signaled opposition to the bill, casting doubt on McConnell’s plans to pass the bill next week.  “The revised Senate health-care bill released today does not include the measures I have been advocating for on behalf of the people of Arizona,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) in a statement, adding he planned to offer amendments to change it.  The GOP’s continuing push — and continuing struggle — to make good on a campaign promise it began invoking seven years ago to “repeal and replace” Obamacare reflected the peril Republicans face whether they pass a bill or not.  On the one hand, the ACA has provided medical coverage for millions of Americans — and has grown more popular as a result. Moderate Republicans remained concerned Thursday that the new proposal would make insurance unaffordable for some "

story1: "President Trump took to Twitter Thursday morning to claim he's caught up in a "WITCH HUNT" led by "bad and conflicted people" following reports that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating him for obstruction of justice.  Trump further claimed it all stems from his critics' "phony collusion" allegations.  The Washington Post reported Wednesday that Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election has expanded to include an examination of whether the president attempted to obstruct justice.  “They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice,” Trump tweeted early Thursday.  He later added: ‘You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some very bad and conflicted people! #MAGA"  Daniel Coats, the current director of national intelligence, Adm. Mike Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency and Richard Ledgett, Rogers’ departed deputy, all agreed to participate in interviews with Mueller’s investigators as early as this week, five anonymous sources briefed on the requestes told the Post.  It wasn’t immediately clear if others have been questioned by the FBI.  Investigators are also reportedly looking for proof of possible financial crimes committed by Trump associates.  “The FBI leak of information regarding the President is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal,” Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Trump’s personal attorney, Marc Kasowitz, said Wednesday.  Mueller’s office declined to comment.  The investigation into obstruction of justice into Trump reportedly started days after former FBI Director James Comey’s May 9 ouster.  According to the Post, a March 22 exchange among Trump, Coats, and CIA Director Mike Pompeo, alone in the White House, is of potential interest to Mueller. Coats reportedly said that Trump had asked him if he could intervene with Comey to get the FBI to back off focus on former national security adviser Michael Flynn as part of the Russia probe."
story2: "For most of this year, we now know, President Donald Trump’s repeated insistence that he wasn’t under investigation in the Russia scandal was in fact true.  It’s not true anymore, according to a new report by the Washington Post.  Reporters Devlin Barrett, Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima, and Sari Horwitz wrote Wednesday evening that special counsel Robert Mueller is now probing “whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice” — an investigation they say began just days after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.  Specifically, they write, “five people briefed” say that Mueller’s team will soon interview Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, along with Rogers’s former deputy, who recently left the government.  A spokesperson for Trump’s personal lawyer issued a statement that conspicuously did not deny the story, merely saying, “The FBI leak of information regarding the President is outrageous, inexcusable, and illegal.”  Many expected that Mueller would at some point turn to the topic of whether the president obstructed justice. But the Post story is the first clearly stated report that he is in fact doing so — a potentially ominous development for the president.  Mueller is likely interviewing Coats and Rogers about a couple of other recent Washington Post stories  To understand why Mueller wants to interview Coats and Rogers, you have to refer back to a pair of other major Washington Post scoops (from some of these same reporters).  First of all, last month, Entous and Nakashima reported that Trump had urged Coats and Rogers “to publicly deny the existence of any evidence” of collusion between his team and Russia — but Coats and Rogers refused to do it.  Then just last week, Entous followed up by reporting a new example of Trump personally trying to interfere with an FBI investigation to protect Flynn.  Entous wrote that after a White House briefing on March 22 — two days after Comey publicly confirmed the investigation into Trump’s team and Russia — Trump requested that everyone present leave the room except Coats and CIA Director Mike Pompeo (just as Trump reportedly did before he asked Comey to drop the Flynn investigation).  Then, according to Entous’s sources (“officials” familiar with Coats’s description of what happened), Trump “started complaining about the FBI investigation and Comey’s handling of it.” He then asked Coats “if he could intervene” with Comey “to get the bureau to back off its focus on former national security adviser Michael Flynn in its Russia probe.”  This was reminiscent of Watergate. The “smoking gun” that did in President Nixon, in the end, was a tape that revealed he ordered his chief of staff to get the CIA to stop the FBI’s investigation into the Watergate break-ins, as Dylan Matthews explains. The difference here is that, so far as we know, Coats refused to carry out Trump’s request.  When asked about this Post story during testimony before the Senate last week, Coats wouldn’t confirm or deny it — saying instead that he didn’t want to talk about his private conversations with the president. But he will likely have to be more forthcoming with Mueller.  Things could get really ugly  Already, in recent days, reports indicated that President Trump is musing about firing Mueller as special counsel, and Trump allies in the media argued that he should do so.  All that was before this new report that Mueller was investigating Trump’s own behavior and conduct in office.  However, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein testified Tuesday that he believed only he could fire Mueller — and said that if he received an order to do so without “good cause,” he’d refuse to carry it out.  So if Trump truly does want Mueller gone, he’d likely have to get rid of Rosenstein too. That is something he could do, in what would be a clear sequel to Nixon’s “Saturday Night Massacre.” (In October 1973, Nixon ordered the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate break-ins fired, and the attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned in protest rather than carry out his order.)  Considering it was the firing of Comey that got him under investigation in the first place, one would think that if President Trump truly does believe he’s innocent, he’d refrain from repeating that mistake with Mueller and worsening his political and legal troubles yet further. One would think."

story1: "Speaking during a joint press conference with Romanian President Klaus Lohannis in the Rose Garden Friday at the White House, President Donald Trump said he is "100 percent" willing to testify under oath about the Russia probe. He also said he is happy to speak with Special Counsel Robert Mueller about the facts of the case.  "I would be glad to tell him exactly what I just told you," he said.  After Comey's testimony, would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of events?    Trump: "100%" https://t.co/DKdpZfYk5w  — CNN (@CNN) June 9, 2017  The President refuted parts of former FBI Director James Comey's testimony in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee as untrue, but also praised him for backing up a number of his own statements about the Russia probe.  "No collusion, no obstruction, he's a leaker," Trump said. "We were very very happy. And frankly, James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said and some of the things that he said just weren't true."    When asked about whether there are tapes of conversations with Comey, the President said, "Oh you're going to be very disappointed when you find out the answer." He added that he might tell reporters the answer in the "very near future."  During testimony yesterday, Comey said he hopes there are tapes of their conversation and that the President decides to release them.  During his remarks, Trump also denied asking Comey for loyalty during a private meeting at the White House earlier this year.  "I hardly know the man [Comey] I'm not going to say, 'I want you to pledge allegiance.' Who would do that?" he said."
story2: "“That was an excuse by the Democrats, who lost an election that some people think they shouldn’t have lost,” he said. “But we were very, very happy, and, frankly, James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said, and some of the things that he said just weren’t true.”  The remarks were a defiant response from Mr. Trump, who had remained uncharacteristically silent on social media during Mr. Comey’s blockbuster day of testimony on Thursday, as the former F.B.I. chief laid out an account that strongly suggested the president’s private exchanges with him had been an attempt to obstruct justice. They escalated an extraordinary public feud between a sitting president and the ousted F.B.I. director who had been investigating his campaign, each now engaging in full-throated accusations that the other is lying.  But Mr. Trump’s comments reflected a highly selective reading of Mr. Comey’s testimony, much of which painted a damaging picture of the president’s conduct. Mr. Comey told Congress that the president had not personally been under investigation while he was the F.B.I. director, and that at one point Mr. Trump suggested he would like to find out whether any of his associates had done anything wrong. But his account also strongly suggested that Mr. Trump had tried to influence his handling of the Russia inquiry.  Mr. Trump denied that he had ever asked Mr. Comey to drop the F.B.I. investigation into his former national security adviser’s dealings with Russia, or asked for a pledge of loyalty, as Mr. Comey asserted Thursday. Those conversations are reflected in memos Mr. Comey wrote, and now are in the possession of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia investigation who was named after Mr. Comey’s firing."

story1: "President Trump Sunday in a highly-anticipated speech to Muslim leaders during his first foreign trip is expected to call for unity in the fight to “stamp out extremism.”  During his second day of his first trip abroad, Trump’s speech in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia will address the leaders of 50 Muslim-majority countries to cast the challenge of extremism as a “battle between good and evil” and urge Arab leaders to “drive out the terrorists from your places of worship,” according to a draft of the speech.  “Our goal is a coalition of nations who share the aim of stamping out extremism and providing our children a hopeful future that does honor to God,” Trump is expected to say according to excerpts of his speech. “Our friends will never question our support, and our enemies will never doubt our determination.”  Trump will tell Muslim leaders that the only way to combat radical terrorism is “if the forces of good are united” and calls for countries to do their “fair share” in the fight.  “America is prepared to stand with you – in pursuit of shared interests and common security,” he will say.  Trump’s centerpiece speech of his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia comes after he joined leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council in an effort to counter the financing of terrorism. The U.S. has joined leaders from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  “This is not a battle between different faiths, different sects, or different civilizations,” Trump will say. “And it means standing together against the murder of innocent Muslims, the oppression of women, the persecution of Jews, and the slaughter of Christians.”  In his first overseas trip as president, Trump pledged to work with Saudi Arabia leader King Salman to bring peace to the Gulf region and forge stronger economic ties, in large part through a roughly $10 billion arms deal.  “That was a tremendous day,” Trump said shortly after signing the arm deal. “Tremendous investments in the United States. Hundreds of billions of dollars of investments into the United States and jobs, jobs, jobs."  The arms deal is part of large, $350 billion economic packages between the ally nations.  Trump and first lady Melania Trump were greeting in Saudi Arabia at the airport by 81-year King Salman, in a red carpet ceremony that also included a military flyover in which several jets left a red, white and blue streamers.  Trump called his visit to Saudi Arabia "a great honor" joined the king in a brief coffee ceremony at the airport terminal before heading to his hotel and the official events of the day.  The next stop in the president’s nine-day trip will be Israel and then the Vatican where he will have an audience with Pope Francis. Next, Trump will meet with allies at a NATO summit in Brussels and the Group of 7 wealthy nations in Sicily.  “Great to be in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,” Trump tweeted upon landing in Saudi Arabia aboard Air Force One. “Looking forward to the afternoon and evening ahead.”  The first lady wore a black pantsuit with a golden belt and did not cover her head for the arrival, consistent with custom for foreign dignitaries visiting Saudi Arabia.  Trump shook hands with the king, compared to then-President Barack Obama in 2009 appearing to bow before then King Abdullah, a move some viewed as a sign of American weakness.  Trump, during his winning presidential campaign and in the first several months of his presidency, has argued that the United States can no longer be the world’s police officer and that other nations must become more self-sufficient in efforts to combat such terror networks as al Qaeda and the Islamic State and in protecting themselves against rogue nations like Iran and North Korea.  After two days of meetings in Riyadh, Trump will travel to Israel and then the Vatican to meet with Pope Francis. Next, Trump will meet with allies at a NATO summit in Brussels and the Group of 7 wealthy nations in Sicily.  The multi-billion dollar arms deal “in the clearest terms possible” shows the United States’ commitment to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf partners and expands economic opportunities, the White House said.  The deal will include tanks, combat ships, missile defense systems, radar and communications and cybersecurity technology. And it will support tens-of-thousands of new jobs in the U.S. defense industrial base, the White House said.  Trump did not address the cameras. But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Saudi Foreign Minister Abdel al Jubeir held a joint press conference.  Jubeir said Trump "certainly has the vision and, we believe, strength to bring about Middle East peace.”  He also called the Trump’s trip a “truly historic visit.”  Said Tillerson: “We’re very proud of this relationship we're embarking on.”  He also took a question about a recent news report about somebody within the White House being a person of interest amid ongoing investigations into whether Trump and his associates colluded with Russia to help Trump win the 2016 presidential race.  Tillerson said he had “no knowledge” about such a person of interest.  White House officials hope the trip gives Trump the opportunity to recalibrate after one of the most difficult stretches of his young presidency. The White House badly bungled the president's stunning firing of FBI Director James Comey, who was overseeing the federal government’s investigation into possible Russia collusion.  Trump on Sunday will also hold meetings with more than 50 Arab and Muslim leaders converging on Riyadh for a regional summit focused largely on combating the Islamic State and other extremist groups.  Still, the centerpiece of Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia will likely be the speech Sunday at the Arab-Islamic-American summit.  White House aides view the address as a counter to Obama's 2009 speech to the Muslim world, which Trump criticized as too apologetic for U.S. actions in the region.  Trump will call for unity in the fight against radicalism in the Muslim world, casting the challenge as a "battle between good and evil" and urging Arab leaders to "drive out the terrorists from your places of worship," according to a draft of the speech obtained by The Associated Press. The draft notably refrains from mentioning democracy and human rights — topics Arab leaders often view as U.S. moralizing — in favor of the more limited goals of peace and stability.  It also abandons some of the harsh anti-Muslim rhetoric that defined Trump's presidential campaign and does not contain the words "radical Islamic terror," a phrase Trump repeatedly criticized Hillary Clinton for not using during last year's campaign.  The Associated Press contributed to this report."

EPA/OSSERVATORE ROMANO/HANDOUT HANDOUT EDITORIAL USE ONLY/NO SALES  Story highlights Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia Saturday His speech is aimed at uniting against terrorism  (CNN) —  President Donald Trump looked to make clear that the United States is not at war with Islam in a major speech here on Sunday, instead defining the battle against terrorist groups as a “battle between good and evil” as he urged Muslim-majority countries to redouble their counterterrorism efforts.  “This is not a battle between different faiths, different sects or different civilizations,” Trump said. “This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it. This is a battle between good and evil.”  In a departure from the Islamophobic rhetoric he sometimes deployed on the campaign trail, Trump acknowledged that the overwhelming majority of victims of terrorism are Muslim, calling Islam “one of the world’s great faiths.” He also dismissed “Islamists” as the “footsoldiers of evil,” with no religious legitimacy, effectively putting distance between Islam and the ideology that fuels terrorist groups like ISIS.  While Trump promised that he was “not here to lecture” the Muslim world, his speech went beyond outreach. In his most forceful argument on Sunday, Trump exhorted Muslim-majority countries to do more to eradicate terrorist groups that claim the mantle of Islam, urging Muslims to “drive out” terrorists.  “Drive them out,” Trump said. “Drive out the terrorists. Drive out the extremists. Drive them out of your places of worship. Drive them out of your communities. Drive them out of your holy land and drive them out of this Earth.”  Middle Eastern countries “cannot wait for American power,” Trump said, but must instead “decide what kind of future they want for themselves, for their countries, and for their children.”  The major speech, which Trump delivered Sunday during an Arab-Islamic-American summit in Riyadh to leaders of 55 Muslim-majority countries, marks Trump’s first effort to reach out to the world’s 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide. The speech was aimed at resetting his relationship with the Muslim world after making a slew of Islamophobic remarks on the campaign trail, calling for a ban on Muslims and declaring “Islam hates us.”  The speech came as the Trump administration defends his executive order banning visitors from six Muslim-majority countries, which was blocked in federal court. The order has been criticized as an attempt for Trump to legally implement his Muslim ban.  Despite his toned down rhetoric, Trump warned the leaders gathered in Riyadh on Sunday that inaction on their part would bring “suffering, death, despair” and listed a series of actions Muslim countries must take to win the battle against terrorists.  “We can only overcome this evil if the forces of good are united and strong and if everyone in this room does their fair share and fulfills their part of the burden,” Trump said. “Muslim majority countries must take the lead in stamping out radicalization.”  Trump sought to disassociate terrorism from religion, but urged Muslim majority countries to “honestly” confront “the crisis of Islamic extremism and the Islamists and Islamic terror of all kinds.

Trump, who wants to accelerate the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, signaled Sunday that he understands he needs a more constructive relationship with Muslim countries if he hopes to succeed in his stated goal of destroying ISIS and other terrorist groups.  He highlighted that “in sheer numbers, the deadliest toll” of terrorist attacks “has been exacted on Arab, Muslim and Middle Eastern nations.”  “More than 95% of the victims of terrorism are themselves Muslim,” he said.  Trump’s comments came after he ticked down a list of major terrorist attacks in the US and also noted that Europe has “also endured unspeakable horror.”  CNN’s Kevin Liptak contributed to this report."

story1: "After hosting German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House on Friday, President Donald Trump took to Twitter Saturday morning to debunk the unfavorable press coverage the visit received.  In a series of tweets, Trump also pressed Germany to pay more money to NATO.  "Despite what you have heard from the FAKE NEWS, I had a GREAT meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Nevertheless, Germany owes...vast sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!"  Despite what you have heard from the FAKE NEWS, I had a GREAT meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Nevertheless, Germany owes..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 18, 2017  ...vast sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 18, 2017  Trump's tweets come after what many media outlets described as a "awkward rapport" between the two leaders.  According to reports, not only did Trump and Merkel share an "awkward" handshake moment in the Oval Office, but during the press conference Trump also said the two have "something in common, perhaps" when it comes to being wiretapped by the Obama administration.  Also during Friday's press conference, Trump reaffirmed the United States' "strong support" for NATO but also reiterated his stance that NATO allies need to "pay their fair share" for the cost of defense.  Trump said many countries owe "vast sums of money" but he declined to identify Germany as one of the nations.  Prior to his inauguration in January, Trump declared NATO "obsolete" but has since modified his stance, telling European leaders the alliance remains of strategic importance. Only the U.S. and four other members currently reach the benchmark of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense. Germany currently spends 1.23 percent of its GDP on defense, but it is being increased.  The Associated Press contributed to this report."
story2: "A White House summit Friday aimed at easing friction between President Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel was undermined by the visible lack of warmth between the two leaders and sharp differences on immigration and trade.  Trump used his first meeting with Merkel to affirm his “strong support” for NATO and to declare he is not an “isolationist” on free trade after a campaign in which he questioned U.S. policies on multilateral security and economic alliances in Europe and elsewhere.  But the two remained far apart on immigration in the wake of Trump’s efforts to impose a temporary travel ban on refugees and immigrants from several majority-Muslim nations in the Middle East and Northern Africa, a move that contrasts sharply with Merkel’s more liberal policies.  For a second time, federal judges this week suspended the president’s executive order, though his administration has vowed to appeal the rulings.  “Immigration is a privilege, not a right,” Trump said at a joint news conference with Merkel, adding, “the safety of our citizens must always come first.”  (The Washington Post)  Merkel’s decision to welcome large numbers of Syrian refugees stands in sharp contrast to Trump’s insistence that the U.S. refu"

story1: "March 16 (UPI) — President Donald Trump on Thursday released a proposed budget that could cut funding to the Environmental Protection Agency by 31 percent and the State Department by 29 percent while boosting military funds.  Stacks of the blueprint — titled “America First” — were delivered to the Government Printing Office bookstore and a 62-page document was posted on the White House website early Thursday.  Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney on Wednesday told reporters the White House proposal will cut the EPA’s budget down from $8.1 billion to $5.7 billion. About 3,200 positions — or more than 20 percent — in the EPA’s workforce of 15,000 would be cut.  The proposed budget would end funding to former President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan — his signature effort to combat climate change by regulating power plants’ carbon dioxide emissions. EPA programs such as the $73 million-a-year Chesapeake Bay cleanup project and the Energy Star program, designed to improve energy efficiency and save consumers money, would lose all funding.  “You can’t drain the swamp and leave all the people in it. So, I guess the first place that comes to mind will be the Environmental Protection Agency,” Mulvaney told reporters. “The president wants a smaller EPA. He thinks they overreach, and the budget reflects that.”  In a Gallup poll released Wednesday, 59 percent of Americans said protecting the environment is more important than continuing use of traditional energy, such as fossil fuels. In the poll, 71 percent of people said the United States should focus on alternative energy to solve U.S. energy problems, while 23 percent said the country should emphasize the production of oil, gas and coal.  The State Department’s core programs face a $10 billion cut. The budget proposal would eliminate climate-change initiatives and slash foreign aid funding, United Nations contributions and cultural exchanges. The proposal also calls for cuts to State Department operations in war-torn areas such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.  Overall, the State Department’s budget would shrink from $52.8 billion to $37.6 billion.  Trump’s proposal would eliminate funding to 19 agencies including the African Development Foundation, the Chemical Safety Board, the National Endowment for the Arts, the U.S. Institute on Peace and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness.  The winners in Trump’s proposed budget are the Defense Department which would see a $52.3 billion increase, the Department of Veteran’s Affairs which would see a $4.4 billion increase and the Department of HomelandSsecurity which will see a $2.8 billion increase.  “There’s no question this is a hard-power budget,” Mulvaney said. “It is not a soft-power budget. This is a hard-power budget. And that was done intentionally. The president very clearly wants to send a message to our allies and our potential adversaries that this is a strong-power administration.”  Trump’s budget requires approval from Congress.  “The administration’s budget isn’t going to be the budget,” said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. “We do the budget here. The administration makes recommendations, but Congress does budgets.”"
story2: "Donald Trump is out to find programs that America doesn’t need. Programs like Meals on Wheels. Sure, it delivers food to millions of seniors, and by helping them stay in their homes it costs hundreds of times less than hospital care. Sounds trivial. It’s gone. And it’s not alone …  The complete elimination of the $3 billion Community Development Block Grant program, which funds popular programs like Meals on Wheels, housing assistance and other community assistance efforts.  Donald Trump is releasing his first budget Thursday morning, and it has a succinct message for the less than wealthy citizens of America: Die.  Trump’s budget wouldn’t just cut off food for seniors and housing assistance to the poor, it also has it in for job training and education. Not only would the budget slash training for unemployed youth and displaced workers, it has another strong message for seniors.  The White House’s proposal would eliminate the Senior Community Service Employment Program, which helps low-income job seekers age 55 and older find work by pairing them with nonprofit organizations and public agencies.  And that doesn’t even touch on some of the real fun of the budget. Like ending support for both NPR and PBS. Destroying the EPA’s ability to enforce the Clean Water or Clean Air Acts. And of course, gutting the State Department to free up more dollars for weapons, because it’s always better to fight a war than talk your way out of one.  Trump’s budget also completely does away with the endowment for the arts and cuts food for starving kids overseas right at the moment the worst famine in decades is kicking in. So the Trump budget kills not just arts and humanities, it also picks off lots and lots of humans.  Ignorant, unskilled, hungry, cruel and violent — that is what you wanted ... right Trump voters?"
